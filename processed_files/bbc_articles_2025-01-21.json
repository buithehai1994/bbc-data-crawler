The latest ONS figures estimated that average weekly earnings in the UK hit \u00a3660 in November, when inflation was 2.6% - the latest figure is 2.5%.\n\"Pay hasn't put this much clear blue water between itself and inflation for around three and a half years, so the difference is palpable. It's leaving us with more money at the end of the month,\" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown.\nMs Coles warned there was a risk rising wages could lead to higher inflation and interest rate cuts being delayed, but added \"on balance, the lack of growth in the economy, and a month of falling inflation, are likely to mean a rate cut in February is still on the cards\".\nAshley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, added some of the Bank's policymakers \"may be worried\" by the resurgence in private sector pay growth, but said she suspected most of them would be \"look at the signs that the loosening in the labour market\", and cut rates.\nThe UK's unemployment rate was estimated to have ticked up to 4.4%, while the estimated number of vacancies dropped 2.9% to 812,000 from October to December, continuing the decline but still remaining above pre-Covid pandemic levels.\nThe ONS advised treating its jobs market figures with \"caution\", due to questions over the relatability of the data caused by low response rates to its survey.\nPetra Tagg, director at recruitment firm Manpower UK, told the BBC's Today programme that organisations had been \"offering high rates of pay\" as they looked for employees with specific skills for jobs in engineering, IT, and artificial intelligence.\nBut she said workers were \"less likely to be moving [companies] as people are more nervous to look for employment in these\u2026 quite concerning times\".\nEconomics at Pantheon Macroeconomics said employment dropped in December as \"firms put hiring on hold\" following tax rises announced on businesses in the Budget.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves, who has been under pressure following figures showing the UK economy has flatlined, decided that firms should bare the brunt of \u00a340bn worth of tax rises, with hikes in the National Insurance rate and a reduction to the threshold for employers.\nBusinesses have repeatedly warned the extra costs, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could impact the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.\nBut Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon, added: \"There is little sign from jobless claims and redundancies of a sharp labour market downturn. The labour market is loosening, but only gradually.\"\nMs Coles said the \"good news on wages\" could be short-lived going further into the year as there was a \"risk\" that businesses facing higher costs \"will cut back on both staff and wage rises\".\nThe UK has had worker shortages for various sectors in recent years. This can drag on economic growth, but can also lead to workers in those industries securing higher pay deals as employers seek to attract them or current bosses try to retain them.\nBut inflation can follow when consumer spending increases as a result of people having more disposable income, pushing up demand for goods and leading to prices in the shops rising.\nRegular pay increased by an annual average of 5.6% between September and November, compared with the same period the year before, but when taking into account inflation, the real wage increase was 3.4%.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the jobs market and wage figures were \"more evidence\" that the UK had to boost employment.\nShe added the government was \"working to boost living standards and get the economy growing\", but reforming Jobcentres and \"guaranteeing every young person has the chance to be earning or learning\".\nDoctors working for Manx Care call off Wednesday's planned walk out as a new pay deal is considered.\nThe number of workers on company payrolls in NI dipped in December, according to official figures.\nApple TV's hit dystopian workplace thriller finally returns after a three-year cliffhanger.\nSales unexpectedly fell last month, due to a poor December for food sales in supermarkets.\nOnBuy founder Cas Patton says BCP Council does not do enough to support Bournemouth's tech industry.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

While they did not materialise on Monday, they are still on the agenda.\n\"We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people, Canada's a very bad abuser also, vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in,\" Trump said in the Oval Office.\nIn a presidential memo, he directed federal agencies to investigate why America continues to import more goods than it exports as well as probing potential unfair trade practices and alleged currency manipulation by other countries.\nTrump also said new tariffs on China could depend on whether a deal is reached over TikTok's future. If Beijing blocked such an agreement \"it would be somewhat of a hostile act\", he said.\nBut he said the US is not yet ready to impose tariffs on all imports into the country.\nDuring the election campaign, Trump pledged a universal tariff of 10% and said he would hit China with a 60% import tax.\nHe hassaid tariffs will make Americans richer, although critics say the costs are likely to be passed on to consumers.\nThe president has also said he would create an \"External Revenue Service\" to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues from foreign sources.\nOn Tuesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up by 0.9%, South Korea's Kospi was flat on the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 ended up by 0.3% and Australia's ASX 200 closed 0.6% higher.\nIn Europe, London's FTSE 100 and Paris's Cac 40 were flat at midday.\nDanish offshore wind giant Orsted was a big loser, with its shares down as much as 17% in morning trade, after announcing a $1.7bn (\u00a31.4bn) impairment charge on delays to a US project and after Trump said he would end leasing to wind farms.\nUS futures pointed towards US markets opening higher, after they were closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr national holiday.\nIn the currency markets \"plans and discussions of levies on Canada and Mexico saw those currencies fall sharply,\" Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, told the BBC's Today programme.\nOil fell on the prospect of more supply, and Bitcoin was higher due to Trump's pledges of support for cryptocurrencies.\nTim Waterer, chief market analyst at financial services firm KCM Trade, said \"market sentiment was dented during the signing of executive orders by President Trump in the Oval Office\".\n\"Investors heard more explicit details regarding the Trump tariff agenda, which sullied the market mood somewhat.\"\nOther analysts warned that Trump's return to the White House will reintroduce an element of unpredictability in the markets.\n\"The first few hours of the Trump administration have underscored that policy environment will be dynamic once again and markets should brace for volatility,\" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment bank Saxo.\nTrump adviser Judy Shelton said Trump's \"main priority is to re-energise the private sector\".\nHe wants to \"unleash the individual through more economic liberty, through lower taxes, through less regulation\", she said.\nShe said tariffs were \"a very effective negotiating tool\" and it will be used \"with our closest neighbours and largest trade partners Mexico and Canada\" with regard to  immigration.\nShe said tariffs would not necessarily be inflationary for Americans - people may not pay higher prices for imported goods, and instead turn to US producers.\nTrump has picked his 27-year-old campaign press secretary to stand behind the podium in the White House briefing room.\nTrump has long been critical of how the Geneva-based institution handled the Covid-19 pandemic.\nNearly 200 nations agreed to try to limit global warming to 1.5C in a 2015 deal signed in the French capital.\nChris Saunders, from Wallsend, has more than 270,000 TikTok followers including many Americans.\nTrump has pardoned almost 1,600 people charged in connection with the 2021 US Capitol riots.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Every rich person has called me about TikTok.\"\nWhen asked by a reporter why he's had a change of heart since trying to ban TikTok in 2020, Trump responded: \"Because I got to use it.\"\nHe floated the possibility of a joint venture running the company, saying he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between \"the United States\" and its Chinese owner ByteDance. But he did not give any further details on how that might work.\nTrump also said he may impose new trade tariffs on China if a deal for the platform is not struck. If Beijing rejected a deal \"it would be somewhat of a hostile act\", he said.\nOn Saturday evening,the Chinese-owned app stopped working for American users, as a law banning it on national security grounds was set to come into effect.\nIt resumed services to its 170 million usersin the US after Trump said he would issue an executive order to give the app a reprieve when he took office.\nBut on Monday it was still not available to download from the Apple and Google app stores.\nThe Biden administration had argued that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.\nOpponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open.\nTikTok's parent company, ByteDance, previously ignored a law requiring it to sell its US operations to avoid a ban.\nThe law was upheld by Supreme Court on Fridayand went into effect on Sunday, but the Biden White House said it would leave implementing the law to the incoming administration given the timing.\nTrump had backed a ban of the platform during his first term in office.\nThe newly signed executive order places him at odds with many members of Congress from his own party.\nOn Sunday in a post on X, Republican Senator Tom Cotton said any company that \"hosts, distributes, services or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok\" could face hundreds of billions of dollars in fines.\nCotton said liability could stem not just from the Department of Justice, \"but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs [attorneys general].

","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/articles\/c4gjry6dv4yo","source":"feeds","type":"articles","Author":["Adrienne Murray"],"Date Published":1737417604073,"Headline":"Inside Iceland's futuristic farm growing algae for food","Content":"In the shadow of Iceland\u2019s largest geothermal power station, a large warehouse houses a hi-tech indoor farm of sorts that\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.\nUnder a strange pink-purple glow, illuminated panels buzz and cylindrical columns of water bubble away as a futuristic crop of microalgae grows.\nIt's here that Iceland's Vaxa Technologies has developed a system that harnesses energy and other resources from the nearby power plant to cultivate these tiny aquatic organisms.\n\u201cIt's a new way of thinking about food production,\u201d says general manager Kristinn Haflidason as he gives me a tour of the space-age facility.\nFor much of our history, humans have consumed seaweed, also known as macroalgae.\nBut its tiny relative, microalgae has been a less common food source, although it was eaten for centuries in ancient Central America and Africa.\nNow scientists and entrepreneurs are increasingly exploring its potential as a nutrition-rich, sustainable food.\nAbout 35 minutes from the capital Reykjavik, the Vaxa site produces the microalgae Nannochloropsis, both as food for people, and for feed in fish and shrimp farming.\nIt also grows a type of bacteria called Arthospira, also known as blue-green algae, as it shares similar properties with microalgae.\nWhen dried out it is known as spirulina and is used as a dietary supplement, a food ingredient, and as a bright-blue food colouring.\nThese tiny organisms photosynthesise, capturing energy from light to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.\n\u201cThe algae is eating CO2, or turning the CO2 into biomass,\u201d explains Mr Haflidason. \u201cIt's carbon negative.\u201d\nVaxa's plant has a unique situation.\nIt's the only place where algae cultivation is integrated with a geothermal power station, which supplies clean electricity, delivers cold water for cultivation, hot water for heating, and even pipes across its CO2 emissions.\n\u201cYou end up with a slightly negative carbon footprint,\u201d says Asger Munch Smidt-Jensen, a food technology consultant at Danish Technology Institute (DTI), who co-authored a study assessing the environmental impact of Vaxa\u2019s spirulina production.\n\u201cWe also found a relatively low footprint, both in terms of land and water use.\u201d\nRound-the-clock renewable energy, plus a stream of CO2, and nutrients with a low carbon footprint, are needed to ensure the setup is climate-friendly, and he thinks that isn\u2019t easily replicated.\n\u201cThere is a huge input of energy to run these photo-bioreactors, and you have to artificially simulate the sun, so you need a high energy light source,\u201d he explains.\n\"My main takeaway is that we should utilise these areas [like Iceland] where we have low impact energy sources to make energy intensive products,\u201d adds Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen.\nBack at the algae plant, I climb onto an elevated platform, where I\u2019m surrounded by noisy modular units called photo-bioreactors, where thousands upon thousands of tiny red and blue LED lights fuel the microalgae\u2019s growth, in place of sunlight.\nThey\u2019re also supplied water and nutrients.\n\u201cMore than 90% of the photosynthesis happens within very specific wavelengths of red and blue light,\u201d explains Mr Haflidason. \u201cWe are only giving them the light that they use.\u201d\nAll the conditions are tightly controlled and optimised by machine learning, he adds.\nAbout 7% of the crop is harvested daily and rapidly replenished by new growth.\nVaxa\u2019s facility can produce up to 150 metric tonnes of algae annually and it plans to expand.\nAs the crops are rich in protein, carbohydrates, omega-3s, fatty-acids, and vitamin B12, Mr Haflidason believes growing microalgae this way could help tackle global food insecurity.\nMany other companies are betting on the potential of microalgae - it's estimated the market will be worth $25.4bn (\u00a320.5bn) by 2033.\nDanish start-up Algiecel has been trialling portable shipping container-sized modules that house photo-bioreactors, and which could link up to carbon-emitting industries to capture their CO2, while simultaneously producing food and feed.\nCrops are also being used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, biofuel and a replacement for plastic.\nPerhaps also microalgae could be produced in space.\nIn a project funded by the European Space Agency, the Danish Technological Institution plans to test if a microalgae can begrown on the International Space Station.\nDespite all the investment, there\u2019s some way to go before microalgae becomes an everyday part of our diet.\nIt still needs a lot of development, according to Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen.\nHe points out that the texture lacks firmness. Meanwhile the taste can be \"fishy\" if the algae is a saltwater variety.\n\u201cBut there are ways of overcoming this,\u201d he adds.\nThere\u2019s also the societal question.\n\u201cAre people ready for it? How do we make it so that everyone wants to eat this?\"\nMalene Lihme Olsen, a food scientist at Copenhagen University who researches micro algae, says its nutritional value needs more research.\n\"Green microalgae [chlorella] have a very robust cell wall, so it can be difficult for us to digest and get all the nutrients,\u201d she says.\nFor now she says microalgae is better added to other \u201ccarrier products\u201d like pasta or bread to help with taste, texture and appearance.\nHowever, Ms Olsen believes microalgae are a promising future food.\n\u201cIf you compare one hectare of soy in Brazil, and imagine we had one hectare of algae field, you could produce 15 times more protein a year [from the algae].\u201d\nBack at the plant I'm looking at an unappetising green sludge. It's the harvested microalgae with the water squeezed out, ready for further processing.\nMr Haflidason offers me a taste and, after initial reluctance, I try some and find its flavour neutral with a texture like tofu.\n\u201cWe are absolutely not proposing that anyone should eat green sludge,\u201d jokes Mr Haflidason.\nInstead the processed algae is an ingredient for everyday foods, and in Reykjavik one bakery makes bread with Spirulina and a gym puts it in smoothies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to change what you eat. We're just going to change the nutritional value of the foods that you eat,\u201d he says.\nSteve Clarke's Scotland will play international friendly matches against Iceland and Liechtenstein in June.\nThe permits allow for annual catches of 209 fin whales and 217 mike whales.\nA road is closed and buses are diverted following the incident in Bearwood in the West Midlands.\nDown below, a car park was swallowed up by lava and buildings were evacuated, but there was said to be no threat to air travel in the region.\nLouise and Matthew Jones-Roberts from Canterbury escaped a wall of molten lava on a trip to Iceland.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

It was one of dozens of executive actions he put his signature to on day one in office.\nThis marks the second time Trump has ordered the US be pulled out of the WHO.\nTrump was critical of how the international body handled Covid-19 and began the process of pulling out from the Geneva-based institution during the pandemic. President Joe Biden later reversed that decision.\nCarrying out this executive action on day one makes it more likely the US will formally leave the global agency.\n\"They wanted us back so badly so we'll see what happens,\" Trump said in the Oval Office, referring to the WHO, perhaps hinting the US might return eventually.\nThe order said the US was withdrawing \"due to the organization's mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states\".\nThe executive order also said the withdrawal was the result of \"unfairly onerous payments\" the US made to the WHO, which is part of the United Nations.\nWhen Trump was still in office the first time around, he was critical of the organisation for being too \"China-centric\" in its tackling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nTrump accused the WHO of being biased towards China in how it issued guidance during the outbreak.\nUnder the Biden administration the US continued to be the largest funder of the WHO and in 2023 it contributed almost one-fifth of the agency's budget.\nThe organisation's annual budget is $6.8bn (\u00a35.5bn).\nIt is possible that funding could disappear almost immediately, and it is not clear that other nations will step up to fill the gap. A US withdrawal could have an impact on WHO's ability to respond to emergencies such as an Ebola outbreak, or MPOX \u2013 let alone another Covid-19-style pandemic.\nPublic health experts have suggested there could be other consequences for Americans' health if progress is reversed on fighting infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and Aids.\nAshish Jha, who formerly worked as Covid-19 response co-ordinator under President Biden, previously warned leaving would \"harm not only the health of people around the world, but also US leadership and scientific prowess\".\n\"It's a cataclysmic presidential decision. Withdrawal is a grievous wound to world health, but a still deeper wound to the US,\" Lawrence Gostin, a global public health expert and Georgetown University professor said.\nThere are also concerns that America's withdrawal could ultimately open the door to greater Chinese influence over the global body, not less.\nThe upsides to the move are few, but some argue it could prompt further reforms of how the WHO works, meaning it better serves public health needs of people worldwide.\nIf that happens, it might be enough to tempt the US back into the fold. However,  the tone of the language coming from Washington suggests this second attempt by President Trump to pull the US out of the international health body will not be reconsidered.\n\n\nTrump has picked his 27-year-old campaign press secretary to stand behind the podium in the White House briefing room.\nThe US president said he is considering imposing new tariffs on Canada and Mexico from 1 February.\nNearly 200 nations agreed to try to limit global warming to 1.5C in a 2015 deal signed in the French capital.\nChris Saunders, from Wallsend, has more than 270,000 TikTok followers including many Americans.\nTrump has pardoned almost 1,600 people charged in connection with the 2021 US Capitol riots.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

He then turned and repeated the action for those sitting behind him.\nMany on X, the social medial platform he owns, have likened the gesture to a Nazi salute.\nIn response, Musk posted on X: \"Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\"\nMusk, the world's richest man and a close ally of President Trump, was speaking at the Capital One Arena in Washington DC when he made the gesture.\n\"My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilisation is assured,\" the 53-year-old said, after giving the second one-armed salute.\nThere was immediate backlash on social media.\nClaire Aubin, a historian who specializes in Nazism within the United States, said Musk's gesture was a \"sieg heil\", or Nazi salute.\n\"My professional opinion is that you're all right, you should believe your eyes,\" she posted on X, in reference to those who believed the gesture to be an overt reference to Nazis.\nRuth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University, said: \"Historian of fascism here. It was a Nazi salute and a very belligerent one too.\"\nAndrea Stroppa, a close confidant of Musk who has connected him with far-right Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, was reported by Italian media to have posted the clip of Musk with the caption: \"Roman Empire is back starting from Roman salute\".\nLIVE:Follow BBC's live coverage\nIN PICTURES:Key moments of the inauguration\nWATCH:The new president's day so far\nEXPLAINED:What Donald Trump could do on day one\nFASHION:Melania's striking hat and other eye-catching looks\nThe Roman salute was widely used in Italy by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party, before later being adopted by Adolf Hitler in Germany.\nStroppa later deleted his post, Italian media said.

ELON DISLIKES EXTREMISTS!\"\nThe gesture comes as Musk's politics have increasingly shifted to the right. He has made recent statements in support of Germany's far-right AfD party and British anti-immigration party Reform UK.\nBut some have defended him, including the Anti-Defamation League, an organisation founded to combat anti-Semitism.\n\"It seems that Elon Musk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute,\" the group posted on X.\nMusk has become one of Trump's closest allies and has been tapped to co-lead what the president has termed the Department of Government Efficiency.\nTrump has picked his 27-year-old campaign press secretary to stand behind the podium in the White House briefing room.\nThe US president said he is considering imposing new tariffs on Canada and Mexico from 1 February.\nTrump has long been critical of how the Geneva-based institution handled the Covid-19 pandemic.\nChris Saunders, from Wallsend, has more than 270,000 TikTok followers including many Americans.\nTrump has pardoned almost 1,600 people charged in connection with the 2021 US Capitol riots.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

He has been detained since last week.\nSecurity was tight on Tuesday as Yoon was transported by van from the detention centre, where he is being held,  to the Constitutional Court.\nPolice formed human walls and held up anti-riot barricades to stop hundreds of his supporters who had gathered nearby from getting too close. Last weekend saw violence as dozens of Yoon's supporters clashed with law enforcers andbroke into another court house.\nOn Tuesday, Yoon was asked if he had ordered military commanders to \"drag out\" lawmakers from parliament on the night he declared martial law, in order to prevent them from overturning his order.\nHe replied: \"No.\"\nMilitary commanders had earlier alleged that Yoon had given such an order on 3 December, after lawmakers climbed fences and broke barricades to enter the parliament building and vote down Yoon's martial law declaration.\n\"I am a person who has lived with a firm belief in liberal democracy,\" Yoon said in his opening remarks on Tuesday.\n\"As the Constitutional Court exists to safeguard the constitution, I ask that you thoroughly examine all aspects of this case,\" he told the judges.\nDuring the hearing, which lasted nearly two hours, Yoon and his lawyers argued that the martial law order was \"a formality that was not meant to be executed\".\nYoon had cited threats from \"anti-state forces\" and North Korea when he declared martial law, but it soon became clear that his move had been spurred not by external threats but by his own domestic political troubles.\nThe lawyers prosecuting the case, who were selected by the parliament, accused Yoon and his lawyers for making \"largely contradictory, irrational, and unclear\" comments.\n\"If they continue to evade responsibility as they did today, it will only work against them in the impeachment trial and cause even greater disappointment among the public,\" the prosecutors told reporters after the hearing.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Yoon's supporters - who have become more agitated and aggressive lately - demanded that the suspended president be released and restored to office immediately.\nThey were forced to set up some distance from the court due to tight security. Waving their trademark combination of Korean and US flags, some wore Maga-style baseball caps embossed with the slogan \"Make Korea Free Again\", an echo of the campaign slogan used by US President Donald Trump.\nSome of their chants included calls for the leader of South Korea's main opposition party, Lee Jae-myung, and the investigator leading Yoon's criminal case to be executed.\nSeveral of the supporters told the BBC they believed Yoon's martial law declaration was an attempt to protect the country's democracy.\nThey accused the opposition party of being pro-China and pro-North Korea, and for wanting to turn South Korea into a communist country.\n\"This is a conflict between people who pursue communism and people who pursue democracy,\" said Wongeun Seong, a 49-year-old businessman who joined the protest on the way back from a lunch meeting.\n\nFormer defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who reportedly suggested martial law to Yoon, will testify during the next hearing on Thursday.\nYoon will be removed from office if at least six of the eight-member Constitutional Court bench votes to uphold the impeachment. A presidential election must then be called within 60 days.\nSouth Korea has been in political chaos since the failed martial law attempt. Thousands of protesters and supporters of Yoon have taken to the streets multiple times despite the winter cold.\nThe crisis has hit the country's economy, with the won weakening and global credit rating agencies warning of weakening consumer and business sentiment.\nAdditional reporting by Hosu Lee in Seoul\nInvestigators have been granted 20 days to bring Yoon to trial over his short-lived martial law decree.\nThey cut through barbed wires and braved freezing temperatures to reach Yoon, ending a weeks-long standoff.\nThe country is deeply polarised by the president's attempt to impose martial law.\nInvestigators have doggedly pursued a president who was suspended from duty for trying to impose martial law.\nThe impeached president said he will comply with questioning to \"prevent unsavoury bloodshed.\"\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/articles\/c4gjry6dv4yo","source":"feeds","type":"articles","Author":["Adrienne Murray"],"Date Published":1737417604073,"Headline":"Inside Iceland's futuristic farm growing algae for food","Content":"In the shadow of Iceland\u2019s largest geothermal power station, a large warehouse houses a hi-tech indoor farm of sorts that\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.\nUnder a strange pink-purple glow, illuminated panels buzz and cylindrical columns of water bubble away as a futuristic crop of microalgae grows.\nIt's here that Iceland's Vaxa Technologies has developed a system that harnesses energy and other resources from the nearby power plant to cultivate these tiny aquatic organisms.\n\u201cIt's a new way of thinking about food production,\u201d says general manager Kristinn Haflidason as he gives me a tour of the space-age facility.\nFor much of our history, humans have consumed seaweed, also known as macroalgae.\nBut its tiny relative, microalgae has been a less common food source, although it was eaten for centuries in ancient Central America and Africa.\nNow scientists and entrepreneurs are increasingly exploring its potential as a nutrition-rich, sustainable food.\nAbout 35 minutes from the capital Reykjavik, the Vaxa site produces the microalgae Nannochloropsis, both as food for people, and for feed in fish and shrimp farming.\nIt also grows a type of bacteria called Arthospira, also known as blue-green algae, as it shares similar properties with microalgae.\nWhen dried out it is known as spirulina and is used as a dietary supplement, a food ingredient, and as a bright-blue food colouring.\nThese tiny organisms photosynthesise, capturing energy from light to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.\n\u201cThe algae is eating CO2, or turning the CO2 into biomass,\u201d explains Mr Haflidason. \u201cIt's carbon negative.\u201d\nVaxa's plant has a unique situation.\nIt's the only place where algae cultivation is integrated with a geothermal power station, which supplies clean electricity, delivers cold water for cultivation, hot water for heating, and even pipes across its CO2 emissions.\n\u201cYou end up with a slightly negative carbon footprint,\u201d says Asger Munch Smidt-Jensen, a food technology consultant at Danish Technology Institute (DTI), who co-authored a study assessing the environmental impact of Vaxa\u2019s spirulina production.\n\u201cWe also found a relatively low footprint, both in terms of land and water use.\u201d\nRound-the-clock renewable energy, plus a stream of CO2, and nutrients with a low carbon footprint, are needed to ensure the setup is climate-friendly, and he thinks that isn\u2019t easily replicated.\n\u201cThere is a huge input of energy to run these photo-bioreactors, and you have to artificially simulate the sun, so you need a high energy light source,\u201d he explains.\n\"My main takeaway is that we should utilise these areas [like Iceland] where we have low impact energy sources to make energy intensive products,\u201d adds Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen.\nBack at the algae plant, I climb onto an elevated platform, where I\u2019m surrounded by noisy modular units called photo-bioreactors, where thousands upon thousands of tiny red and blue LED lights fuel the microalgae\u2019s growth, in place of sunlight.\nThey\u2019re also supplied water and nutrients.\n\u201cMore than 90% of the photosynthesis happens within very specific wavelengths of red and blue light,\u201d explains Mr Haflidason. \u201cWe are only giving them the light that they use.\u201d\nAll the conditions are tightly controlled and optimised by machine learning, he adds.\nAbout 7% of the crop is harvested daily and rapidly replenished by new growth.\nVaxa\u2019s facility can produce up to 150 metric tonnes of algae annually and it plans to expand.\nAs the crops are rich in protein, carbohydrates, omega-3s, fatty-acids, and vitamin B12, Mr Haflidason believes growing microalgae this way could help tackle global food insecurity.\nMany other companies are betting on the potential of microalgae - it's estimated the market will be worth $25.4bn (\u00a320.5bn) by 2033.\nDanish start-up Algiecel has been trialling portable shipping container-sized modules that house photo-bioreactors, and which could link up to carbon-emitting industries to capture their CO2, while simultaneously producing food and feed.\nCrops are also being used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, biofuel and a replacement for plastic.\nPerhaps also microalgae could be produced in space.\nIn a project funded by the European Space Agency, the Danish Technological Institution plans to test if a microalgae can begrown on the International Space Station.\nDespite all the investment, there\u2019s some way to go before microalgae becomes an everyday part of our diet.\nIt still needs a lot of development, according to Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen.\nHe points out that the texture lacks firmness. Meanwhile the taste can be \"fishy\" if the algae is a saltwater variety.\n\u201cBut there are ways of overcoming this,\u201d he adds.\nThere\u2019s also the societal question.\n\u201cAre people ready for it? How do we make it so that everyone wants to eat this?\"\nMalene Lihme Olsen, a food scientist at Copenhagen University who researches micro algae, says its nutritional value needs more research.\n\"Green microalgae [chlorella] have a very robust cell wall, so it can be difficult for us to digest and get all the nutrients,\u201d she says.\nFor now she says microalgae is better added to other \u201ccarrier products\u201d like pasta or bread to help with taste, texture and appearance.\nHowever, Ms Olsen believes microalgae are a promising future food.\n\u201cIf you compare one hectare of soy in Brazil, and imagine we had one hectare of algae field, you could produce 15 times more protein a year [from the algae].\u201d\nBack at the plant I'm looking at an unappetising green sludge. It's the harvested microalgae with the water squeezed out, ready for further processing.\nMr Haflidason offers me a taste and, after initial reluctance, I try some and find its flavour neutral with a texture like tofu.\n\u201cWe are absolutely not proposing that anyone should eat green sludge,\u201d jokes Mr Haflidason.\nInstead the processed algae is an ingredient for everyday foods, and in Reykjavik one bakery makes bread with Spirulina and a gym puts it in smoothies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to change what you eat. We're just going to change the nutritional value of the foods that you eat,\u201d he says.\nSteve Clarke's Scotland will play international friendly matches against Iceland and Liechtenstein in June.\nThe permits allow for annual catches of 209 fin whales and 217 mike whales.\nA road is closed and buses are diverted following the incident in Bearwood in the West Midlands.\nDown below, a car park was swallowed up by lava and buildings were evacuated, but there was said to be no threat to air travel in the region.\nLouise and Matthew Jones-Roberts from Canterbury escaped a wall of molten lava on a trip to Iceland.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

{"title":"Best of 'frenemies': Trump's relationship with Europe this time may be very different","description":"Weak, distracted and unprepared? How prepared France, Germany and the rest of the continent really are for his return to power","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/articles\/c93ll927v18o","source":"feeds","type":"articles","Author":["Katya Adler"],"Date Published":1737417694921,"Headline":"Where Trump's 'frenemy' relationship with Europe goes from here","Content":"\"It's insane! We're heading for a general election. The country feels broken. Our economy is stagnant... But most German news outlets just seem obsessed with Trump, Trump, Trump!\"\nIris M\u00fchler, a teacher in engineering in north-east Germany is one of a number of voters I've been talking to ahead of February snap elections. She isn't alone in her perception.\nDespite facing a whole raft of its own domestic difficulties - not least in leading EU countries, Germany and France - Europe has been very Trump-focused since he won the US presidential election in November.\nThe continent had a bumpy ride last time he was in the White House. Many fear Trump 2.0 could be a lot worse. And Europe's traditional powers are already struggling with their own problems.\nFrance and Germany aremired in political and economic woes, the EU as a whole lags behind China and the US in terms of competitiveness, while in the UK, public services are in a woeful state.\nSo: is the continent prepared for Donald Trump or has it been caught napping at the wheel (again)?\nWhen it comes to trade and defence, Trump acts more like a transactional businessman than a US statesman who prizes transatlantic alliances dating back to World War Two.\n\"He simply doesn't believe in win-win partnerships,\" the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel told me. She experienced Trump last time he was in office and concluded he views the world through the prism of winners and losers.\nHe's convinced that Europe has taken advantage of the US for years and that's got to stop.\nLeaders in Europe havewatched open-mouthedthese last weeks since Trump won the US presidential election, for the second time. He's chosen to publicly lambast allies in Europe and Canada, rather than focus his ire on those he recognises as a strategic threat, like China.\nTrump dangles thepossibility of abandoning Nato- the transatlantic military alliance that Europe has relied on for its security for decades. He has said he'd \"encourage\" Russia to do \"whatever the hell they want\" with European allies if they \"don't pay\" their way more and boost their defence spending.\nWhen it comes to trade, Trump is clearly as livid with the EU now as he was during his first term in office. The bloc sells far more to the United States than it imports from the US. In January 2022, the trade surplus was \u20ac15.4 billion (\u00a313 billion).\nDonald Trump's answer? He says he'll imposeblanket tariffs on all foreign importsof 10-20%, with even higher tariffs on certain goods like cars.\nThat's a disaster scenario for Germany, which relies on exports and the automobile industry in particular. Its economy is already spluttering - last year it shrunk by 0.2%.\nAs the biggest economy in the eurozone, financial difficulties in Germany risk affecting the currency as a whole.\nMerkel has said that when he was president last time, Trump appeared to have it in for Germany.\nIan Bond, the deputy director for the Centre for European Reform, believes the country will remain \"top of Trump's (European) hit list.\"\n\"What he said in the past is things like, he doesn't want to see any Mercedes-Benz on the streets of New York. Now, this is kind of nuts, because, actually, most of the Mercedes-Benz that you see on the streets of New York are made in Alabama, where Mercedes has a big plant.\n\"He has often been more hostile to Germany than any other country in Europe. It might be slightly easier for Germany with a new and more conservative government (after the upcoming general election), but I wouldn't be holding my breath.\"\nThe UK hopes to avoid Trump tariffsas it doesn't have such a trade imbalance with the US, but it may well get lashed by tail winds if it comes to an EU-US trade war.\nTrump's bullish style can come as no surprise to allies after his first term in the White House. The real conundrum for Europe now is his unpredictability: How much is bluster and intimidation and how much is a promise of action?\nIan Lesser, vice president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States think tank, believes Trump's tariff threats are real and that Europe is far from ready.\n\"They're not prepared, no one really is. This very different approach to global trade upsets many cornerstones of the international economy, which has evolved over decades.\"\nThe European Commission claims to be ready for any number of moves by Trump when he returns to the White House. It is a huge trade power on the world stage. But Mr Lesser says the biggest impact on Europe could come if Trump launches anaggressive trade war against China. That could result in supply chain disruptions for Europe and Beijing dumping even more cheap products on European markets, to the detriment of local businesses.\n\"For Europe it's double exposure: exposure to what America might do and then what China will do in response.\"\nWhat complicates things further is that trade and defence aren't separate issues for Trump and his administration. He recently refused to rule out economic and\/or military action against EU and Nato member Denmark if it didn't hand over the autonomous territory Greenland to the US.\nAnd Trump's incoming vice president appeared, this autumn, to make US defence of Europe conditional on EU regulatory bodies stepping away from the social platform X.\nJD Vance warned the US could pull its support for Nato if the EU continued alongstanding investigation into X, which is owned by Trump's Golden Boy, Elon Musk.\nRecently, Mr Musk also displayed a keenness for taking sides in European politics. He launched repeated online attacks against centre-left European leaders Sir Keir Starmer in the UK and outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Musk posted on X that the extreme anti-migration AfD party was Germany's only hope.\nThis shocked many in Europe but pollsters suggest Mr Musk's controversial posts have little actual influence on European public opinion.\nTrump and Mr Musk are widely distrusted in Europe, as clearly illustrated in a new poll commissioned by the European Council of Foreign Relations, entitled The EU and global public opinion after the US elections.\nIn the end, different European leaders have different approaches to \"Taming the Trump,\" as insiders describe attempts. Some flatter his not-exactly-tiny ego.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is the expert here. He was one of thefirst world leaders to congratulate Trumpon social media after his re-election in November and he swiftly invited him to attend the glittering and dignitary-resplendent re-opening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.\nWhen he was first in the White House, President Macron wowed Trump as guest of honour at the annual display of pomp and military might of Bastille Day in Paris.\nThe UK, meanwhile, knows Trump has a soft spot for Scotland, where his mother comes from, and for the British Royal Family. He visibly relishedattending a state banquetwith the now-late Queen Elizabeth II in 2019. He heaped praise on Prince William after sitting down with him this autumn.\nOthers in Europe favour flashing the cash.\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) chief, Christine Lagarde, has advised Europe's leaders to adopt a \"cheque-book strategy\" and negotiate with Trump rather than retaliate against his proposed tariffs.\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, speaks of buying more (expensive) US liquified natural gas (LNG) as part of Europe's effort to diversify its energy supplies. It has been weaning itself off a reliance on cheap Russian gas since the Kremlin launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nSources in the Commission also speak of possibly buying more US agricultural products and weapons.\nMacron, meanwhile, has long advocated what he calls \"strategic autonomy\" - essentially Europe learning to be more self-sufficient, in order to survive.\n\"Europe... can die and that depends entirely on our choices,\" he said this spring.\nCovid showed Europe how dependent it was on Chinese imports, like medicines. Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine exposed Europe'sover-reliance on Russian energy.\nMacron is now sounding the alarm about the US: \"The United States of America has two priorities. The USA first, and that is legitimate, and the China issue, second. And the European issue is not a geopolitical priority for the coming years and decades.\"\nTrump's return to the White House is making European leaders think about continental weaknesses.\nWhen it comes to defence, Trump's insistence that Europe spend more is generally accepted (though how much more is a hot topic of debate). But where Trump talks in terms of increasing GDP spending, Europeans are discussing how to spend their defence budgets more wisely and in a more joined-up way to boost continental safety.\nEmmanuel Macron wants an EU-wide industrial defence policy. He says the war in Ukraine illustrated that \"our fragmentation is a weakness... We have sometimes discovered ourselves, as Europeans, that our guns were not of the same calibre, that our missiles did not match.\"\nEurope frets that Trump will not want to continuebeing the main sponsor of military aid to Ukraineas was the case under the Biden administration.\nNext month, EU leaders have invited the UK - one of Europe's two big military powers - to an informal summit to discuss working together better on security and defence.\nThe EU's defence chief and former Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, believes European unity of purpose is needed. \"We need to act in a united way. Then, we are strong. Then, we are also serious on the world stage.\"\nThere are analysts who say Europe is in a far weaker, more fractured state to deal with Trump 2.0 than it was in 2016 when he was first elected. I'd say the answer to that is yes. But also no.\nYes - as discussed, economic growth is sluggish and politics are volatile.\nPopulist nationalist eurosceptic parties are gaining strength in many European countries. Some, like Germany's AfD, are soft on Moscow - while others like Italian PM Giorgia Meloni may be tempted to prioritise transatlantic ties with Trump rather than European unity.\nBut beware of looking back at Europe when Trump was first elected president through rose-tinted spectacles.\nFinancially, northern Europe was definitely doing better than it is now, but, in terms of unity, the continent was deeply divided on the back of the migrant crisis in 2015. Populist eurosceptic parties were also on the rise then and, following the Brexit vote in June 2016, there were widespread predictions the EU would soon lose other member countries and fall apart altogether.\nFast forward to 2025 and the EU has weathered Brexit, the Covid pandemic, the migration crisis and Trump's first term in office - and countries very much pulled together afterRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nIt was more of a stumbling, rather than sailing through these successive crises, but the EU is still standing and the wounds of Brexit, for example, have healed with time.\nPost-Brexit UK is seen by the EU as a close ally that shares the same values in a world threatened by an ambitious China, an expansionist Russia and an unpredictable, bullish incoming US president.\nNato, meanwhile, though worried about Trump's commitment to the alliance, has been boosted militarily and geostrategically by Sweden and Russian neighbour Finland becoming members following the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nMaybe, just maybe, Trump will see fewer differences that frustrate and antagonise him about Europe this time round.\nIt's a Europe that recognises the need to spend more on defence, as he demands; that is far warier of China, as he expects, and that is more right-leaning in its politics, as he prefers.\nIs it a Europe whose leaders also stand up to Trump, despite threats and bluster, if they feel he crosses a line - be it over human rights, free speech or dallying with dictators?\nThe next chapter in relations between transatlantic frenemies waits to be written.\nBBC InDepthis the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.
