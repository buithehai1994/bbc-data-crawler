Pay after inflation rises at fastest rate since 2021,"Wage growth increased by 3.4% after taking into account inflation, driven by strong increases in the private sector.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g372w32vjo,feeds,articles,['Michael Race'],2025-01-21 07:11:07.216000+00:00,Pay after inflation rises at fastest rate since 2021,"UK pay after inflation has risen at its fastest rate for more than three years, driven by strong wage growth in the private sector.
Pay packets increased on average by 3.4% between September and November compared with the same period a year ago after taking into account the impact of price rises, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Growth in private sector earnings was stronger than for public sector jobs.
Despite a risk of higher wages pushing up inflation, the Bank of England is still expected to cut interest rates next month.
Rates are currently at 4.75%, but traders have bet on a cut to 4.5% in February, after inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at over time, unexpectedly fell last month.
The Bank of England watches the pay and jobs data closely when making decisions on interest rates. The latest ONS figures estimated that average weekly earnings in the UK hit £660 in November, when inflation was 2.6% - the latest figure is 2.5%.
""Pay hasn't put this much clear blue water between itself and inflation for around three and a half years, so the difference is palpable. It's leaving us with more money at the end of the month,"" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown.
Ms Coles warned there was a risk rising wages could lead to higher inflation and interest rate cuts being delayed, but added ""on balance, the lack of growth in the economy, and a month of falling inflation, are likely to mean a rate cut in February is still on the cards"".
Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, added some of the Bank's policymakers ""may be worried"" by the resurgence in private sector pay growth, but said she suspected most of them would be ""look at the signs that the loosening in the labour market"", and cut rates.
The UK's unemployment rate was estimated to have ticked up to 4.4%, while the estimated number of vacancies dropped 2.9% to 812,000 from October to December, continuing the decline but still remaining above pre-Covid pandemic levels.
The ONS advised treating its jobs market figures with ""caution"", due to questions over the relatability of the data caused by low response rates to its survey.
Petra Tagg, director at recruitment firm Manpower UK, told the BBC's Today programme that organisations had been ""offering high rates of pay"" as they looked for employees with specific skills for jobs in engineering, IT, and artificial intelligence.
But she said workers were ""less likely to be moving [companies] as people are more nervous to look for employment in these… quite concerning times"".
Economics at Pantheon Macroeconomics said employment dropped in December as ""firms put hiring on hold"" following tax rises announced on businesses in the Budget.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has been under pressure following figures showing the UK economy has flatlined, decided that firms should bare the brunt of £40bn worth of tax rises, with hikes in the National Insurance rate and a reduction to the threshold for employers.
Businesses have repeatedly warned the extra costs, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could impact the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.
But Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon, added: ""There is little sign from jobless claims and redundancies of a sharp labour market downturn. The labour market is loosening, but only gradually.""
Ms Coles said the ""good news on wages"" could be short-lived going further into the year as there was a ""risk"" that businesses facing higher costs ""will cut back on both staff and wage rises"".
The UK has had worker shortages for various sectors in recent years. This can drag on economic growth, but can also lead to workers in those industries securing higher pay deals as employers seek to attract them or current bosses try to retain them.
But inflation can follow when consumer spending increases as a result of people having more disposable income, pushing up demand for goods and leading to prices in the shops rising.
Regular pay increased by an annual average of 5.6% between September and November, compared with the same period the year before, but when taking into account inflation, the real wage increase was 3.4%.
Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the jobs market and wage figures were ""more evidence"" that the UK had to boost employment.
She added the government was ""working to boost living standards and get the economy growing"", but reforming Jobcentres and ""guaranteeing every young person has the chance to be earning or learning"".

Heathrow and Gatwick airport could expand under plans,Airports across the UK could expand as part of the government's drive for economic growth.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgl800vy1wo,feeds,articles,['Faarea Masud'],2025-01-21 09:37:40.741000+00:00,Heathrow and Gatwick airport could expand under plans,"Airports across the UK could be expanded, including the controversial third runway at Heathrow, under government growth plans.
The Treasury is looking at whether to support a third runway at Heathrow, approve a second runway at Gatwick, and increase capacity at Luton airport.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she is ""not going to comment on leaks"" when asked in the House of Commons about the expansion on Tuesday.
The new Labour government has made economic growth a key part of its messaging, with Reeves pledging to go ""further and faster"".
Reeves could make an announcement on airports next week in a speech, the BBC understands.
When asked on Tuesday about whether she supports a proposed third runway at Heathrow, Reeves said: ""What I would say is this government is absolutely committed to growing our economy and making this a great place for businesses to invest and trade in.""
Reeves will arrive in Davos later on Tuesday for the World Economic Forum, where she will say that the UK is ""on the up"" as she meets business leaders and investors from around the world.
A government spokesperson told the BBC it does ""not comment on speculation"" but that the government is ""determined to get our economy moving and secure the long-term future of the UK's aviation sector""
They added: ""All expansion proposals must demonstrate they contribute to economic growth, which is central to our Plan for Change, while remaining in line with existing environmental obligations.""
The push for growth has become more urgent after international markets cast doubt on the credibility of the UK's economic plans, withUK borrowing costs soaringand the pound falling.
The boss of Heathrow Airport, Thomas Woldbye,said in Decemberthat his company needs a ""clear steer"" from the new government by the end of 2025 over plans to expand the airport and build a third runway.
The government is due to make a decision on Gatwick airport's plans for expansion by 27 February.
Gatwick wants to increase its capacity to 75 million passengers per year, according to the previously published plans. Its previous record pre-covid was 47 million.
Gatwick is aiming to complete the project by the end of the decade if the plans go ahead.
Meanwhile, a decision on Luton airport's expansion, which includes plans for a new terminal, is due by 3 April.
Airport expansions were delayed under the previous Conservative government because of their environmental impact and objections from airport-neighbouring communities over noise.
Heathrow's expansion plans have been divisive for the Labour party in the past, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer voting against a third runway in 2018 while Reeves supported it.
If any airport expansions were to go ahead, they would prove ""vital"" to the UK's business growth, said director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Shevaun Haviland.
She added that all three projects would ""help boost trade"" at a time of increased costs for many businesses.
""These airport proposals must form a key part of the UK's long-term infrastructure strategy to help businesses grow, trade and thrive,"" she said.
The airline says subsidies paid to other operators were not considered.
A ""number of incidents"" were blamed for disruption to train services on Tuesday morning.
Customers of a coach tour operator say they are owed thousands of pounds as it shuts down.

Stock markets cautious as Trump signals new tariffs,The US president said he is considering imposing new tariffs on Canada and Mexico from 1 February.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1ezgdj7wvpo,feeds,articles,['João da Silva'],2025-01-21 00:49:46.632000+00:00,Stock markets cautious as Trump signals new tariffs,"Global stock markets swayed on Tuesday, as investors tried to digest what US President Donald Trump will do on tariffs.
In his inaugural address Trump stopped short of announcing fresh import taxes on his first day in office, though he later said new tariffs on Mexico and Canada could come on 1 February.
Shares in Europe opened slightly higher before falling back, while those in Asia saw modest gains.
Trump has promised an ambitious agenda - including trade reforms, lower taxes and cuts to government regulations - which has the potential to boost company profits.
But some economists have warned that the measures may also raise inflation, which in turn could force the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates.
The dollar, which had fallen on Monday after the inauguration, regained some ground against some other major currencies, including the pound and the euro.
Trump had previously threatened new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on day one of his presidency. While they did not materialise on Monday, they are still on the agenda.
""We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people, Canada's a very bad abuser also, vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in,"" Trump said in the Oval Office.
In a presidential memo, he directed federal agencies to investigate why America continues to import more goods than it exports as well as probing potential unfair trade practices and alleged currency manipulation by other countries.
Trump also said new tariffs on China could depend on whether a deal is reached over TikTok's future. If Beijing blocked such an agreement ""it would be somewhat of a hostile act"", he said.
But he said the US is not yet ready to impose tariffs on all imports into the country.
During the election campaign, Trump pledged a universal tariff of 10% and said he would hit China with a 60% import tax.
He hassaid tariffs will make Americans richer, although critics say the costs are likely to be passed on to consumers.
The president has also said he would create an ""External Revenue Service"" to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues from foreign sources.
On Tuesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up by 0.9%, South Korea's Kospi was flat on the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 ended up by 0.3% and Australia's ASX 200 closed 0.6% higher.
In Europe, London's FTSE 100 and Paris's Cac 40 were flat at midday.
Danish offshore wind giant Orsted was a big loser, with its shares down as much as 17% in morning trade, after announcing a $1.7bn (£1.4bn) impairment charge on delays to a US project and after Trump said he would end leasing to wind farms.
US futures pointed towards US markets opening higher, after they were closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr national holiday.
In the currency markets ""plans and discussions of levies on Canada and Mexico saw those currencies fall sharply,"" Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, told the BBC's Today programme.
Oil fell on the prospect of more supply, and Bitcoin was higher due to Trump's pledges of support for cryptocurrencies.
Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at financial services firm KCM Trade, said ""market sentiment was dented during the signing of executive orders by President Trump in the Oval Office"".
""Investors heard more explicit details regarding the Trump tariff agenda, which sullied the market mood somewhat.""
Other analysts warned that Trump's return to the White House will reintroduce an element of unpredictability in the markets.
""The first few hours of the Trump administration have underscored that policy environment will be dynamic once again and markets should brace for volatility,"" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment bank Saxo.
Trump adviser Judy Shelton said Trump's ""main priority is to re-energise the private sector"".
He wants to ""unleash the individual through more economic liberty, through lower taxes, through less regulation"", she said.
She said tariffs were ""a very effective negotiating tool"" and it will be used ""with our closest neighbours and largest trade partners Mexico and Canada"" with regard to  immigration.
She said tariffs would not necessarily be inflationary for Americans - people may not pay higher prices for imported goods, and instead turn to US producers.
Trump has picked his 27-year-old campaign press secretary to stand behind the podium in the White House briefing room.
Trump has long been critical of how the Geneva-based institution handled the Covid-19 pandemic.
Nearly 200 nations agreed to try to limit global warming to 1.5C in a 2015 deal signed in the French capital.
Chris Saunders, from Wallsend, has more than 270,000 TikTok followers including many Americans.
Trump has pardoned almost 1,600 people charged in connection with the 2021 US Capitol riots.

Delay to TikTok ban gets Trump sign-off ,The order was among a slew of directives Trump signed on Monday evening.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0j24rj4ryo,feeds,articles,['Lily Jamali and Peter Hoskins'],2025-01-21 02:12:14.130000+00:00,President Trump signs executive order delaying TikTok ban,"President Trump has signed an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day extension to comply with a law that requires a sale or ban of the platform.
He says during that time, the US will not enforce the law passed by Congress last year and signed by former President Joe Biden.
The order was amonga slew of directives Trump signed on Monday evening.
Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, he said: ""I tell you what. Every rich person has called me about TikTok.""
When asked by a reporter why he's had a change of heart since trying to ban TikTok in 2020, Trump responded: ""Because I got to use it.""
He floated the possibility of a joint venture running the company, saying he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between ""the United States"" and its Chinese owner ByteDance. But he did not give any further details on how that might work.
Trump also said he may impose new trade tariffs on China if a deal for the platform is not struck. If Beijing rejected a deal ""it would be somewhat of a hostile act"", he said.
On Saturday evening,the Chinese-owned app stopped working for American users, as a law banning it on national security grounds was set to come into effect.
It resumed services to its 170 million usersin the US after Trump said he would issue an executive order to give the app a reprieve when he took office.
But on Monday it was still not available to download from the Apple and Google app stores.
The Biden administration had argued that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.
Opponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open.
TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, previously ignored a law requiring it to sell its US operations to avoid a ban.
The law was upheld by Supreme Court on Fridayand went into effect on Sunday, but the Biden White House said it would leave implementing the law to the incoming administration given the timing.
Trump had backed a ban of the platform during his first term in office.
The newly signed executive order places him at odds with many members of Congress from his own party.
On Sunday in a post on X, Republican Senator Tom Cotton said any company that ""hosts, distributes, services or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok"" could face hundreds of billions of dollars in fines.
Cotton said liability could stem not just from the Department of Justice, ""but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs [attorneys general]. Think about it"".
TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew attended Trump's inauguration on Monday along with other bosses of big technology firms, including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos.
Earlier on Monday, YouTube star MrBeast posted a TikTok video of him apparently from a private jet on his way to make an official offer to buy the short video platform.
The post gave no other details about the offer, only that it would be ""crazy"".
Other companies, billionaires and celebrities have expressed interest in buying TikTok, including X owner Musk and an investor from the TV show Shark Tank, Kevin O'Leary.

Inside Iceland's futuristic farm growing algae for food,Next to a geothermal plant in Iceland a start-up is growing microalgae for food. ,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjry6dv4yo,feeds,articles,['Adrienne Murray'],2025-01-21 00:00:04.073000+00:00,Inside Iceland's futuristic farm growing algae for food,"In the shadow of Iceland’s largest geothermal power station, a large warehouse houses a hi-tech indoor farm of sorts that’s like nothing I’ve ever seen.
Under a strange pink-purple glow, illuminated panels buzz and cylindrical columns of water bubble away as a futuristic crop of microalgae grows.
It's here that Iceland's Vaxa Technologies has developed a system that harnesses energy and other resources from the nearby power plant to cultivate these tiny aquatic organisms.
“It's a new way of thinking about food production,” says general manager Kristinn Haflidason as he gives me a tour of the space-age facility.
For much of our history, humans have consumed seaweed, also known as macroalgae.
But its tiny relative, microalgae has been a less common food source, although it was eaten for centuries in ancient Central America and Africa.
Now scientists and entrepreneurs are increasingly exploring its potential as a nutrition-rich, sustainable food.
About 35 minutes from the capital Reykjavik, the Vaxa site produces the microalgae Nannochloropsis, both as food for people, and for feed in fish and shrimp farming.
It also grows a type of bacteria called Arthospira, also known as blue-green algae, as it shares similar properties with microalgae.
When dried out it is known as spirulina and is used as a dietary supplement, a food ingredient, and as a bright-blue food colouring.
These tiny organisms photosynthesise, capturing energy from light to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.
“The algae is eating CO2, or turning the CO2 into biomass,” explains Mr Haflidason. “It's carbon negative.”
Vaxa's plant has a unique situation.
It's the only place where algae cultivation is integrated with a geothermal power station, which supplies clean electricity, delivers cold water for cultivation, hot water for heating, and even pipes across its CO2 emissions.
“You end up with a slightly negative carbon footprint,” says Asger Munch Smidt-Jensen, a food technology consultant at Danish Technology Institute (DTI), who co-authored a study assessing the environmental impact of Vaxa’s spirulina production.
“We also found a relatively low footprint, both in terms of land and water use.”
Round-the-clock renewable energy, plus a stream of CO2, and nutrients with a low carbon footprint, are needed to ensure the setup is climate-friendly, and he thinks that isn’t easily replicated.
“There is a huge input of energy to run these photo-bioreactors, and you have to artificially simulate the sun, so you need a high energy light source,” he explains.
""My main takeaway is that we should utilise these areas [like Iceland] where we have low impact energy sources to make energy intensive products,” adds Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen.
Back at the algae plant, I climb onto an elevated platform, where I’m surrounded by noisy modular units called photo-bioreactors, where thousands upon thousands of tiny red and blue LED lights fuel the microalgae’s growth, in place of sunlight.
They’re also supplied water and nutrients.
“More than 90% of the photosynthesis happens within very specific wavelengths of red and blue light,” explains Mr Haflidason. “We are only giving them the light that they use.”
All the conditions are tightly controlled and optimised by machine learning, he adds.
About 7% of the crop is harvested daily and rapidly replenished by new growth.
Vaxa’s facility can produce up to 150 metric tonnes of algae annually and it plans to expand.
As the crops are rich in protein, carbohydrates, omega-3s, fatty-acids, and vitamin B12, Mr Haflidason believes growing microalgae this way could help tackle global food insecurity.
Many other companies are betting on the potential of microalgae - it's estimated the market will be worth $25.4bn (£20.5bn) by 2033.
Danish start-up Algiecel has been trialling portable shipping container-sized modules that house photo-bioreactors, and which could link up to carbon-emitting industries to capture their CO2, while simultaneously producing food and feed.
Crops are also being used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, biofuel and a replacement for plastic.
Perhaps also microalgae could be produced in space.
In a project funded by the European Space Agency, the Danish Technological Institution plans to test if a microalgae can begrown on the International Space Station.
Despite all the investment, there’s some way to go before microalgae becomes an everyday part of our diet.
It still needs a lot of development, according to Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen.
He points out that the texture lacks firmness. Meanwhile the taste can be ""fishy"" if the algae is a saltwater variety.
“But there are ways of overcoming this,” he adds.
There’s also the societal question.
“Are people ready for it? How do we make it so that everyone wants to eat this?""
Malene Lihme Olsen, a food scientist at Copenhagen University who researches micro algae, says its nutritional value needs more research.
""Green microalgae [chlorella] have a very robust cell wall, so it can be difficult for us to digest and get all the nutrients,” she says.
For now she says microalgae is better added to other “carrier products” like pasta or bread to help with taste, texture and appearance.
However, Ms Olsen believes microalgae are a promising future food.
“If you compare one hectare of soy in Brazil, and imagine we had one hectare of algae field, you could produce 15 times more protein a year [from the algae].”
Back at the plant I'm looking at an unappetising green sludge. It's the harvested microalgae with the water squeezed out, ready for further processing.
Mr Haflidason offers me a taste and, after initial reluctance, I try some and find its flavour neutral with a texture like tofu.
“We are absolutely not proposing that anyone should eat green sludge,” jokes Mr Haflidason.
Instead the processed algae is an ingredient for everyday foods, and in Reykjavik one bakery makes bread with Spirulina and a gym puts it in smoothies.
“We’re not going to change what you eat. We're just going to change the nutritional value of the foods that you eat,” he says.
Steve Clarke's Scotland will play international friendly matches against Iceland and Liechtenstein in June.
The permits allow for annual catches of 209 fin whales and 217 mike whales.
A road is closed and buses are diverted following the incident in Bearwood in the West Midlands.
Down below, a car park was swallowed up by lava and buildings were evacuated, but there was said to be no threat to air travel in the region.
Louise and Matthew Jones-Roberts from Canterbury escaped a wall of molten lava on a trip to Iceland.

'Council left autistic son with no school place'  ,Kray says Birmingham City Council failed to provide an education plan within the legal timeframe.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywpgkg012o,feeds,articles,['Louise Brierley'],2025-01-21 06:14:21.304000+00:00,Birmingham chef's anger at delay in care plan for autistic son,"A man has been left frustrated after having to apply for a mainstream school for his autistic son, because a council missed a care plan deadline.
Kray's four-year-old son Bodhi has not had an education, health and care plan (EHCP) issued by Birmingham City Council, which is needed to apply for a special school place.
""He's entitled to an education, so for him to just get pushed back when we've done everything right is just annoying"", said Kray.
Birmingham City Council has been approached for comment.
Kray, who runs 670 Grams in Digbeth, Birmingham, said Bodhi was seen by a paediatrician in February 2024, who then referred him for an autism assessment.
Councils have a legal time limit of 20 weeks, in most cases, to issue an EHCP after a professional asks for an assessment, but growing demand and insufficient funding is resulting in delays.
The 33-year-old said without an EHCP he could not apply for a specialist school before the window for school applications closed this month.
Kray said he felt a mainstream school would not be able to cope with his son.
Bodhi displays many of the signs of autism including not speaking, not responding to his name, not being able to sit still and not interacting with other children or adults.
Both he and his wife Sacha, who is also a chef, first started noticing the signs when he was one year old, and his nursery picked up on it too.
Now that the school application window has closed, they fear they have missed their opportunity to get him a place at a specialist school, many of which are oversubscribed.
Their concern is that if the school they have applied to cannot cope with Bodhi, he will be out of school and will have to be educated at home.
For the couple, who have three young children and work full-time running their Michelin-listed restaurant, home-schooling is not a viable option.
""Obviously the children come first but we need that business to just live a nice life,"" said Kray.
Data from the Department for Education shows that hundreds of other children in Birmingham are also facing delays to the support they need.
In 2023 the city council's rate for getting EHCPs issued on time was 58.9% (652 of 1,107).
That was better than the national average for that year, which was 49.1%
To give Bodhi the best possible chance of getting into a good specialist school, the family have now moved out of Birmingham to Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire.
But without the EHCP they are in the same position as they were in Birmingham.
Sacha said she wondered how anyone got their children into a specialist school from reception age.
The 29-year-old said they had begun the process to see a paediatrician when Bodhi was two and did everything their end as quickly as possible.
She described the whole process as an ""awfully long waiting game"".

Actress Pauline Quirke reveals dementia diagnosis,The Birds of a Feather star retires from acting and reveals she was diagnosed with dementia in 2021.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxengknyvgo,feeds,articles,['Helen Bushby'],2025-01-21 08:34:59.711000+00:00,Pauline Quirke: Birds of a Feather star reveals dementia diagnosis,"Pauline Quirke, famous for starring in TV sitcom Birds of a Feather, has retired from acting following a dementia diagnosis, her husband has said.
""It is with a heavy heart that I announce my wife Pauline's decision to step back from all professional and commercial duties due to her diagnosis of dementia in 2021,"" Steve Sheen said.
Her diagnosis was not made public at the time.
""Pauline has been an inspiration through her work in the film and TV industry, her charity endeavours and as the founder of the very successful Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts (PQA),"" Mr Sheen added.
Mr Sheen praised his wife's ""talent, dedication, and vision"".
He said her drama academy had ""touched countless lives and will continue to do so through the legacy of her work and through PQA where her vision and guidance has facilitated many young peoples' progression and interest in the arts and enhanced their self-confidence"".
Quirke, 65, was best-known as an actress for her role as Sharon Theodopolopodous on the long-running sitcom Birds of a Feather, winning a British Comedy Award in 1990for the role.
It ran from 1989 to 1998 on BBC One, and then on ITV from 2014 to 2020.
The series followed the lives of sisters Tracey and Sharon, played by Linda Robson and Quirke, who have to fend for themselves after their husbands are arrested for armed robbery.
Quirke and Robson met as children at drama school in north London.
The pair also worked together in ITV comedy drama Shine On Harvey Moon, set in London's post-war East End, from 1982 to 1985.
In 1997, Quirke was nominated for a Bafta award for playing convicted murderer Olive Martin in BBC drama The Sculptress, based on Minette Walters' psychological thriller novel.
She also received four National Television Awards nominations - three for Birds of a Feather and one for BBC drama series Down to Earth in 2002.
Quirke also starred in BBC detective drama Maisie Raine from 1998 to 1999, appeared in ITV's Broadchurch, and played Hazel Rhodes in Emmerdale from 2010 to 2012.
In 2022, Quirke was made an MBE for services to the entertainment industry, young people, and charities.
PQA has about 250 academies and more than 15,000 students across the UK, and will ""continue to operate as normal in accordance with Pauline's ideology"", Mr  Sheen said.
The academy said it was ""deeply moved by the messages that we have received"",writing on Instagram: ""It has been wonderful to see how many lives Pauline has touched through her work with PQA and in her 50-year career in film and television.
""Improving the lives of young people through the performing arts has been PQA's ethos since Pauline and Steve opened their first academy in 2007, and remains central to everything that we do.""
Mr Sheen requested privacy and understanding for his wife and her family, saying they would not be making further statements.
""Pauline just wants to spend time with her family, children and grandchildren,"" he added.
Quirke and Mr Sheen married in 1996, and they have ""pledged future support"" for Alzheimer's Research UK to help raise funds for research and awareness, the charity said.
Hilary Evans-Newton, chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK, said they were ""saddened"" to hear about the actress's diagnosis.
""The family should be praised for making the brave decision to make her diagnosis public, which will not only provide more freedom for them, but also raise such vital awareness of the condition,"" she said.
Dementia UK CEO and Chief Admiral Nurse Dr Hilda Hayo added: ""By choosing to speak publicly about her condition, Pauline will raise vital awareness for young onset dementia.
""We hope this will encourage others to seek support if they are concerned about their brain health.""
Mr Sheen also praised late actress Dame Barbara Windsor's husband Scott Mitchell for his work with the charity following her dementia diagnosis.

Whitesnake guitarist John Sykes dies at 65,"A statement said Sykes, who co-wrote some of the rock band's chart hits, had been ill with cancer.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8qvz0gq90o,feeds,articles,['Christy Cooney'],2025-01-21 04:40:41.637000+00:00,Whitesnake and Thin Lizzy guitarist John Sykes dies at 65,"The British rock guitarist John Sykes, who played with Whitesnake and Thin Lizzy, has died aged 65.
A statement on his website said Sykes ""passed away after a hard fought battle with cancer"".
It described him as a ""thoughtful, kind, and charismatic man whose presence lit up the room"" and said that, in his final days, he had expressed a ""sincere love and gratitude for his fans"".
Sykes appeared on two Whitesnake albums and co-wrote some of the band's best-known songs, including Still Of The Night and Is This Love.
He began his career in 1980 with heavy metal band Tygers Of Pan Tang, recording two albums before joining Thin Lizzy in 1982.
He played on the 1983 release Thunder and Lightning before accompanying frontman Phil Lynott on a European tour with a separate group called The Three Musketeers.
In 1984, he joined Whitesnake at the invitation of founder and frontman David Coverdale, recording parts for their Slide It In album and later for their self-titled 1987 release which was a critical and commercial success.
After leaving Whitesnake he released two albums with his own group, Blue Murder, and later formed a touring version of Thin Lizzy which had disbanded in the years before Lynott's death in 1986.
The statement on Sykes's website read: ""It is with great sorrow we share that John Sykes has passed away after a hard fought battle with cancer.
""He will be remembered by many as a man with exceptional musical talent but for those who didn't know him personally, he was a thoughtful, kind, and charismatic man whose presence lit up the room.
""He certainly marched to the beat of his own drum and always pulled for the underdog. In his final days, he spoke of his sincere love and gratitude for his fans who stuck by him through all these years.
""While the impact of his loss is profound and the mood sombre, we hope the light of his memory will extinguish the shadow of his absence.""
Paying tribute on X, Coverdale shared a number of photos of himself and and Sykes together in Whitesnake's heyday.
""Just heard the shocking news of John's passing…"" he said.
""My sincere condolences to his family, friends & fans…""
Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash shared a picture of Sykes performing and wrote simply: ""RIP"".

The government says the assistants - called Humphrey - will ""speed up the work of civil servants"" and save money by replacing cash that would have been spent on consultants.
But the decision to name the AI after Sir Humphrey Appleby,a character described as""devious and controlling"", has raised eyebrows.
Tim Flagg, chief operating officer of trade body UKAI, said the name risked ""undermining"" the government's mission to embrace the tech.

""Humphrey for me is a name which is very associated with the Machiavellian character from Yes, Minister,"" says Mr Flagg from UKAI, which represents the AI sector.
""That immediately makes people who aren't in that central Whitehall office think that this is something which is not going to be empowering and not going to be helping them.""

Extra £1.5m needed to complete Jersey Opera House,The theatre says additional funding is needed to install modern staging and lighting equipment.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dgre230r3o,feeds,articles,['Elliot Ball'],2025-01-21 06:08:17.025000+00:00,Extra £1.5m needed to complete Jersey Opera House,"The Jersey Opera House has warned it must find an extra £1.5m if it is to complete its refurbishment.
A spokesperson for the venue said without the funding ""the range and quality of performances we can host will be significantly limited"".
It comes after theGovernment of Jersey invested more than £12 million into the project, which began in March 2020.
Work was due to be completed by the summer of 2022 but the plans were delayed due to the complexity of renovation work.
A Jersey Opera House statement said: ""Essential technical infrastructure upgrades are still required to ensure that the Opera House can operate as a fully equipped theatre.
""Without these upgrades, we have a beautiful building but the type of productions it can stage is severely limited, affecting local productions and reducing the scale and quality of events we can both present and bring to the island.""
The statement explained modern staging and lighting equipment were ""essential"" to meet the standards of a ""mid-scale receiving theatre"".
Further upgrades such as a new prompt desk, performance communication systems and the supporting cabling infrastructure would also be needed.
In May 2024, States Minister Kirsten Morel said hehoped the first shows at the refurbished theatre would be on by Easter 2025.

Trump orders US to leave World Health Organization,Trump has long been critical of how the Geneva-based institution handled the Covid-19 pandemic.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c391j738rm3o,feeds,articles,['Ana Faguy'],2025-01-21 02:11:36.045000+00:00,Trump orders US to leave World Health Organization,"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the US from the World Health Organization (WHO).
""Oooh, that's a big one,"" the newly inaugurated US president said as he approved the document after arriving back at the White House. It was one of dozens of executive actions he put his signature to on day one in office.
This marks the second time Trump has ordered the US be pulled out of the WHO.
Trump was critical of how the international body handled Covid-19 and began the process of pulling out from the Geneva-based institution during the pandemic. President Joe Biden later reversed that decision.
Carrying out this executive action on day one makes it more likely the US will formally leave the global agency.
""They wanted us back so badly so we'll see what happens,"" Trump said in the Oval Office, referring to the WHO, perhaps hinting the US might return eventually.
The order said the US was withdrawing ""due to the organization's mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states"".
The executive order also said the withdrawal was the result of ""unfairly onerous payments"" the US made to the WHO, which is part of the United Nations.
When Trump was still in office the first time around, he was critical of the organisation for being too ""China-centric"" in its tackling of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Trump accused the WHO of being biased towards China in how it issued guidance during the outbreak.
Under the Biden administration the US continued to be the largest funder of the WHO and in 2023 it contributed almost one-fifth of the agency's budget.
The organisation's annual budget is $6.8bn (£5.5bn).
It is possible that funding could disappear almost immediately, and it is not clear that other nations will step up to fill the gap. A US withdrawal could have an impact on WHO's ability to respond to emergencies such as an Ebola outbreak, or MPOX – let alone another Covid-19-style pandemic.
Public health experts have suggested there could be other consequences for Americans' health if progress is reversed on fighting infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and Aids.
Ashish Jha, who formerly worked as Covid-19 response co-ordinator under President Biden, previously warned leaving would ""harm not only the health of people around the world, but also US leadership and scientific prowess"".
""It's a cataclysmic presidential decision. Withdrawal is a grievous wound to world health, but a still deeper wound to the US,"" Lawrence Gostin, a global public health expert and Georgetown University professor said.
There are also concerns that America's withdrawal could ultimately open the door to greater Chinese influence over the global body, not less.
The upsides to the move are few, but some argue it could prompt further reforms of how the WHO works, meaning it better serves public health needs of people worldwide.
If that happens, it might be enough to tempt the US back into the fold. However,  the tone of the language coming from Washington suggests this second attempt by President Trump to pull the US out of the international health body will not be reconsidered.


Trump has picked his 27-year-old campaign press secretary to stand behind the podium in the White House briefing room.
The US president said he is considering imposing new tariffs on Canada and Mexico from 1 February.
Nearly 200 nations agreed to try to limit global warming to 1.5C in a 2015 deal signed in the French capital.
Chris Saunders, from Wallsend, has more than 270,000 TikTok followers including many Americans.
Trump has pardoned almost 1,600 people charged in connection with the 2021 US Capitol riots.

Instagram hides search results for 'Democrats',"Meta says it is working quickly to resolve the problem, which has prompted accusations of bias on social media.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g32yxpdz0o,feeds,articles,['Tom Gerken'],2025-01-21 12:30:12.353000+00:00,Instagram hides search results for 'Democrats',"Meta says its working urgently to fix a problem with Instagram which results in a ""results hidden"" message when users search for the terms ""Democrat"" or ""Democrats"".
Some social media users have accused the company of political bias, pointing out the issue has been occurring after President Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday,which was attended by Meta owner Mark Zuckerberg.
Social media expert Matt Navarra said it was more likely to be a technical problem but told the BBC it was ""embarrassing"" for Instagram regardless.
""In a hyper-partisan environment, even unintentional errors like this can escalate into accusations of partisanship,"" he said.
""If these issues are not resolved quickly they risk fuelling conspiracy theories and damaging Meta's reputation.""
While users who type ""#Democrat"" or ""#Democrats"" see no results, the hashtag ""Republican"" returns 3.3 million posts on the social media platform.
By manually searching Instagram for ""Democrats"", rather than clicking on a hashtag, users are greeted by a screen reading ""we've hidden these results"".
""Results for the term you searched for may contain sensitive content,"" it says.
There are also limited results when people search for ""Republicans"" as opposed to ""Republican"".
""We're aware of an error affecting hashtags across the political spectrum and we are working quickly to resolve it"", Meta told the BBC in a statement.
Mr Zuckerberg attending Trump's return to office is the latest in a series of moves that have seen him - and other tech bosses - move closer to the incoming Republican administration.
In January, Meta announceda major shake-upof its policies towards how material on its platforms is moderated, with Mr Zuckerberg citing the ""cultural tipping point"" Trump's re-election represented.
Joel Kaplan, a prominent Republican, has been chosen to replace Sir Nick Clegg as Meta's global affairs chief.
Mr Zuckerbergvisited the US president at his resort in Mar-a-Lagoin November and Metamade a donationto a Tump fund.
Trump and his allies previously criticised Met, claiming censor right-wing voice and even threatened the Meta boss with jail.
However reacting to its decision to axe fact checkers, Trump told a news conference he was impressed by Zuckerberg's decision and said Meta had ""come a long way"".

Delay to TikTok ban gets Trump sign-off ,The order was among a slew of directives Trump signed on Monday evening.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0j24rj4ryo,feeds,articles,['Lily Jamali and Peter Hoskins'],2025-01-21 02:12:14.130000+00:00,President Trump signs executive order delaying TikTok ban,"President Trump has signed an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day extension to comply with a law that requires a sale or ban of the platform.
He says during that time, the US will not enforce the law passed by Congress last year and signed by former President Joe Biden.
The order was amonga slew of directives Trump signed on Monday evening.
Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, he said: ""I tell you what. Every rich person has called me about TikTok.""
When asked by a reporter why he's had a change of heart since trying to ban TikTok in 2020, Trump responded: ""Because I got to use it.""
He floated the possibility of a joint venture running the company, saying he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between ""the United States"" and its Chinese owner ByteDance. But he did not give any further details on how that might work.
Trump also said he may impose new trade tariffs on China if a deal for the platform is not struck. If Beijing rejected a deal ""it would be somewhat of a hostile act"", he said.
On Saturday evening,the Chinese-owned app stopped working for American users, as a law banning it on national security grounds was set to come into effect.
It resumed services to its 170 million usersin the US after Trump said he would issue an executive order to give the app a reprieve when he took office.
But on Monday it was still not available to download from the Apple and Google app stores.
The Biden administration had argued that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.
Opponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open.
TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, previously ignored a law requiring it to sell its US operations to avoid a ban.
The law was upheld by Supreme Court on Fridayand went into effect on Sunday, but the Biden White House said it would leave implementing the law to the incoming administration given the timing.
Trump had backed a ban of the platform during his first term in office.
The newly signed executive order places him at odds with many members of Congress from his own party.
On Sunday in a post on X, Republican Senator Tom Cotton said any company that ""hosts, distributes, services or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok"" could face hundreds of billions of dollars in fines.
Cotton said liability could stem not just from the Department of Justice, ""but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs [attorneys general]. Think about it"".
TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew attended Trump's inauguration on Monday along with other bosses of big technology firms, including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos.
Earlier on Monday, YouTube star MrBeast posted a TikTok video of him apparently from a private jet on his way to make an official offer to buy the short video platform.
The post gave no other details about the offer, only that it would be ""crazy"".
Other companies, billionaires and celebrities have expressed interest in buying TikTok, including X owner Musk and an investor from the TV show Shark Tank, Kevin O'Leary.

Musk responds to backlash over gesture at Trump rally,"The billionaire says his critics ""need better dirty tricks"" after a gesture likened to a Nazi salute.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy48v1x4dv4o,feeds,articles,['George Wright'],2025-01-21 10:56:47.631000+00:00,Elon Musk responds to backlash over gesture at Donald Trump rally,"Elon Musk has caused outrage over a one-armed gesture he gave during a speech celebrating the inauguration of Donald Trump.
Musk thanked the crowd for ""making it happen"", before placing his right hand over his heart and then thrusting the same arm out into air straight ahead of him. He then turned and repeated the action for those sitting behind him.
Many on X, the social medial platform he owns, have likened the gesture to a Nazi salute.
In response, Musk posted on X: ""Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.""
Musk, the world's richest man and a close ally of President Trump, was speaking at the Capital One Arena in Washington DC when he made the gesture.
""My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilisation is assured,"" the 53-year-old said, after giving the second one-armed salute.
There was immediate backlash on social media.
Claire Aubin, a historian who specializes in Nazism within the United States, said Musk's gesture was a ""sieg heil"", or Nazi salute.
""My professional opinion is that you're all right, you should believe your eyes,"" she posted on X, in reference to those who believed the gesture to be an overt reference to Nazis.
Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University, said: ""Historian of fascism here. It was a Nazi salute and a very belligerent one too.""
Andrea Stroppa, a close confidant of Musk who has connected him with far-right Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, was reported by Italian media to have posted the clip of Musk with the caption: ""Roman Empire is back starting from Roman salute"".

The Roman salute was widely used in Italy by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party, before later being adopted by Adolf Hitler in Germany.
Stroppa later deleted his post, Italian media said. He later posted that ""that gesture, which some mistook for a Nazi salute, is simply Elon, who has autism, expressing his feelings by saying, 'I want to give my heart to you',"" he said.
""That is exactly what he communicated into the microphone. ELON DISLIKES EXTREMISTS!""
The gesture comes as Musk's politics have increasingly shifted to the right. He has made recent statements in support of Germany's far-right AfD party and British anti-immigration party Reform UK.
But some have defended him, including the Anti-Defamation League, an organisation founded to combat anti-Semitism.
""It seems that Elon Musk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute,"" the group posted on X.
Musk has become one of Trump's closest allies and has been tapped to co-lead what the president has termed the Department of Government Efficiency.
Trump has picked his 27-year-old campaign press secretary to stand behind the podium in the White House briefing room.

Scores killed as fire engulfs Turkish ski hotel,"Dozens more have been injured in the blaze, which broke out at the Grand Kartal Hotel. ",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g375x0zpwo,feeds,articles,['Kathryn Armstrong'],2025-01-21 09:08:40.412000+00:00,Scores killed as fire engulfs Turkish ski resort hotel,"A fire has engulfed a hotel in the Turkish ski resort of Bolu, killing 66 people and injuring at least 51 more, officials have said.
The fire broke out at the 12-storey Grand Kartal Hotel at 03:27 local time (00:27 GMT) during a busy holiday period when 234 people were staying there, he added.
An initial toll of 10 dead was raised significantly in the hours after the fire by Turkey's interior ministry. At least two people died after jumping from the hotel's windows, Turkish reports said.
Footage circulating in Turkey showed linen hanging from windows which was used by those trying to escape the burning building.
Bolu governor Abdulaziz Aydin said initial reports suggested the fire had broken out in the restaurant section of the hotel's fourth floor and spread to the floors above.
The hotel was investigating whether guests had been trapped in their rooms as the fire spread.
The governor told reporters the distance between the hotel, in Kartalkaya, and the centre of Bolu, paired with the freezing weather conditions, meant it took more than an hour for fire engines to arrive.
Rescue efforts continued through the morning, and the interior minister said emergency services had deployed 267 people to respond to the fire.
By mid-morning the local mayor said they were still trying to reach parts of the hotel.
The Bolu mountains are popular with skiers from Istanbul and the capital Ankara and the hotel was operating at high occupancy at the start of two-week school holidays.
The north-western town is about 170km (105 miles) from Ankara.
Although the fire was confined to one hotel, the governor told Turkish media that a neighbouring hotel was evacuated as a precaution.
Ski instructor Necmi Kepcetutan told Turkish TV he had managed to escape because he knew the hotel, while guests who did not know it as well as him were not as fortunate.
""People were shouting at the windows, 'Save us,' because there was intense smoke inside. We pulled 20-25 people out,""  he told NTV.
The circumstances that led to the fire are not yet clear.
Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said prosecutors had been allocated to investigate the blaze.
An inquest opens into the death of Tyler Kerry, found fatally injured in a lift shaft in a Turkish hotel.
They received hefty sentences after 72 people were killed when the building fell in the 2023 quake.
Officials are investigating the cause of the accident that engulfed part of the building in fire.

Six Palestinians killed as Israeli forces launch major operation in Jenin,"Israel's prime minister says the ""large-scale"" operation aims to ""eradicate terrorism"" in the West Bank city.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg750yzdr8o,feeds,articles,['David Gritten'],2025-01-21 12:36:42.366000+00:00,Six Palestinians killed as Israel launches operation in Jenin,"At least six Palestinians have been killed and 35 injured by Israeli security forces after they launched a major operation in Jenin in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry says.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's military, police and Shin Bet security service had launched an ""extensive and significant"" operation to ""defeat terrorism"" in Jenin.
Palestinian media said Israeli military vehicles moved into Jenin and its refugee camp on Tuesday morning following several drone strikes.
It comes after a weeks-long operation by Palestinian security forces against armed groups, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which they see as a challenge to their authority.
A statement from Israel's prime minister said the operation was an ""additional step in achieving the objective we have set: bolstering security"" in the West Bank.
""We are acting methodically and with determination against the Iranian axis wherever it reaches: in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and [the West Bank] – and we are still active,"" he added.
An Israeli military statement said the operation was called ""Iron Wall"" and that it would continue ""as long as necessary"".
Jenin's governor, Kamal Abu al-Rub, told AFP news agency that ""what is happening is an invasion of the camp"".

There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the ensuing war in Gaza.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids, saying they are trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel.
Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.
BBC special correspondent Fergal Keane has travelled with a convoy carrying aid towards Gaza.

US trades Taliban prisoner for two American detainees,Two Americans held by the Taliban were exchanged for an Afghan imprisoned in the US on narco-terrorism charges.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgl8zl7014o,feeds,articles,['Lyse Doucet'],2025-01-21 10:57:35.623000+00:00,US trades Taliban prisoner for American detainees Ryan Corbett and William Wallace McKenty,"Two Americans held by the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan have been exchanged for an Afghan imprisoned in the US on drug trafficking and terrorism charges.
The news emerged after Ryan Corbett and William Wallace McKenty were freed. The Afghan, Khan Mohmmad, had been serving a life sentence in a federal prison in California on drug trafficking and terrorism charges.
A statement from the Taliban government in Kabul announced the agreement, which was concluded just before President Joe Biden ended his term in office.
Mr Corbett's release was confirmed by his family. US media, quoting official sources, identified Mr McKenty as the second American.


The deal – reportedly the culmination of two years of negotiations - was done just before Joe Biden handed over power to Donald Trump on Monday.
""An Afghan fighter Khan Mohammed imprisoned in America has been released in exchange for American citizens and returned to the country,"" the Taliban foreign ministry said in a statement.
The family of Ryan Corbett thanked both administrations as well as Qatar for what they described as its vital role.
""Today, our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise to God for sustaining Ryan's life and bringing him back home after what has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,"" the family said.
Mr Corbett had lived in Afghanistan for many years with his family and was detained by the Taliban more than two years ago when he returned on a business trip.
There are few details about Mr McKenty, whose family have asked for privacy.


Khan Mohammad was a member of the Taliban taken captive in Afghanistan during the US's military engagement. He wasjailed in 2008. Joe Biden commuted his sentence just before he left office.
The Taliban called the exchange the result of ""long and fruitful negotiations"" with the US and ""a good example of resolving issues through dialogue"".
""The Islamic Emirate looks positively at the actions of the United States of America that help the normalisation and development of relations between the two countries,"" it said.
Since the Taliban took power in 2021, they have not been formally recognised by any government.
While the move is not likely to change relations between Kabul and Washington, more negotiations may follow –two other Americans are still in Afghanistan, believed to be George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi.
The Taliban are also seeking the release of an Afghan who is one of the few remaining prisoners at the US's Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
At a rally in Washington on the eve of his inauguration, President Trump threatened to cut humanitarian aid to Afghanistan unless the Taliban returned the military equipment seized after the US pulled out in 2021.
A USDepartment of Defense report in 2022 estimated that military equipment worth $7bn had been left behindin Afghanistan after US forces withdrew.
Trump has picked his 27-year-old campaign press secretary to stand behind the podium in the White House briefing room.
Trump has pardoned almost 1,600 people charged in connection with the 2021 US Capitol riots.

"Antisemitic crimes may be funded overseas, say Australian police",The country's federal police says it will increase efforts to deal with surging anti-Jewish crimes.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8057j0mz5mo,feeds,articles,['Kathryn Armstrong'],2025-01-21 12:09:25.818000+00:00,Australian police say antisemitic crimes may be funded overseas,"Australia's federal police have said they are investigating whether ""overseas actors or individuals"" are paying criminals to carry out antisemitic crimes in the country.
There has been a spate of such incidents in recent months, the latest of which saw a childcare centre in Sydney set alight and sprayed with anti-Jewish graffiti. No-one was injured.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called a snap cabinet meeting in response, where officials agreed to set up a national database to track antisemitic incidents.
Thus far, the federal police taskforce, set up in December to investigate such incidents, received more than 166 reports of antisemitic crimes.
""We are looking into whether overseas actors or individuals have paid local criminals in Australia to carry out some of these crimes in our suburbs,"" Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Reece Kershaw said, adding that it was possible that cryptocurrency was involved.
The digital currency can take longer to identify, Mr Kershaw said.
The commissioner said police were also investigating whether young people were carrying out these crimes and whether they had been radicalised online.
However, Mr Kershaw cautioned, ""intelligence is not the same as evidence"" and more charges were expected soon.
Last week, a man from Sydney became the first person to be charged by the federal taskforce, dubbed Special Operation Avalite, over alleged death threats he made towards a Jewish organisation.
Albanese said Tuesday's incident at a childcare centre in the eastern Sydney suburb of Maroubra was ""as cowardly as it is disgusting"" and described it as a ""hate crime"".
""This was an attack targeted at the Jewish community. And it is a crime that concerns us all because it is also an attack on the nation and society we have built together,"" he wrote on social media.
The Jewish Council of Australia, which was set up last year in opposition to antisemitism, said that it ""strongly condemns"" this and all such incidents.
""These acts underscore the urgent need for cooperation, education and community dialogue to combat prejudice and promote understanding,"" it said in a statement.
Most of the recent incidents have taken place in Sydney and have involved antisemitic graffiti, arson and vandalism of buildings including synagogues.
New South Wales has set up its own state-level taskforce to address these incidents and 36 people been charged so far with antisemtic related offences.
A further 70 arrests have been made for similar crimes in the neighbouring state of Victoria, wherea synagogue was set on fire last month.

South Korea president denies ordering arrest of MPs,Yoon Suk Yeol has made his first appearance at an impeachment trial which will decide if he should be permanently removed.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wed43183eo,feeds,articles,['Kelly Ng'],2025-01-21 10:19:54.265000+00:00,South Korea president Yoon Suk Yeol denies ordering arrest of lawmakers at impeachment trial,"South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol has made his first appearance at his impeachment trial, where he denied ordering the arrest of lawmakers during his attempt to impose martial law.
Parliament voted to impeach Yoon last month, and last weekthe Constitutional Court began a trialto decide whether to permanently remove him from office.
Yoon is also facing a separate criminal investigation into whether he led an insurrection. He has been detained since last week.
Security was tight on Tuesday as Yoon was transported by van from the detention centre, where he is being held,  to the Constitutional Court.
Police formed human walls and held up anti-riot barricades to stop hundreds of his supporters who had gathered nearby from getting too close. Last weekend saw violence as dozens of Yoon's supporters clashed with law enforcers andbroke into another court house.
On Tuesday, Yoon was asked if he had ordered military commanders to ""drag out"" lawmakers from parliament on the night he declared martial law, in order to prevent them from overturning his order.
He replied: ""No.""
Military commanders had earlier alleged that Yoon had given such an order on 3 December, after lawmakers climbed fences and broke barricades to enter the parliament building and vote down Yoon's martial law declaration.
""I am a person who has lived with a firm belief in liberal democracy,"" Yoon said in his opening remarks on Tuesday.
""As the Constitutional Court exists to safeguard the constitution, I ask that you thoroughly examine all aspects of this case,"" he told the judges.
During the hearing, which lasted nearly two hours, Yoon and his lawyers argued that the martial law order was ""a formality that was not meant to be executed"".
Yoon had cited threats from ""anti-state forces"" and North Korea when he declared martial law, but it soon became clear that his move had been spurred not by external threats but by his own domestic political troubles.
The lawyers prosecuting the case, who were selected by the parliament, accused Yoon and his lawyers for making ""largely contradictory, irrational, and unclear"" comments.
""If they continue to evade responsibility as they did today, it will only work against them in the impeachment trial and cause even greater disappointment among the public,"" the prosecutors told reporters after the hearing.

Outside the courtroom, Yoon's supporters - who have become more agitated and aggressive lately - demanded that the suspended president be released and restored to office immediately.
They were forced to set up some distance from the court due to tight security. Waving their trademark combination of Korean and US flags, some wore Maga-style baseball caps embossed with the slogan ""Make Korea Free Again"", an echo of the campaign slogan used by US President Donald Trump.
Some of their chants included calls for the leader of South Korea's main opposition party, Lee Jae-myung, and the investigator leading Yoon's criminal case to be executed.
Several of the supporters told the BBC they believed Yoon's martial law declaration was an attempt to protect the country's democracy.
They accused the opposition party of being pro-China and pro-North Korea, and for wanting to turn South Korea into a communist country.
""This is a conflict between people who pursue communism and people who pursue democracy,"" said Wongeun Seong, a 49-year-old businessman who joined the protest on the way back from a lunch meeting.

Former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who reportedly suggested martial law to Yoon, will testify during the next hearing on Thursday.
Yoon will be removed from office if at least six of the eight-member Constitutional Court bench votes to uphold the impeachment. A presidential election must then be called within 60 days.
South Korea has been in political chaos since the failed martial law attempt. Thousands of protesters and supporters of Yoon have taken to the streets multiple times despite the winter cold.
The crisis has hit the country's economy, with the won weakening and global credit rating agencies warning of weakening consumer and business sentiment.
Additional reporting by Hosu Lee in Seoul
Investigators have been granted 20 days to bring Yoon to trial over his short-lived martial law decree.
They cut through barbed wires and braved freezing temperatures to reach Yoon, ending a weeks-long standoff.
The country is deeply polarised by the president's attempt to impose martial law.
Investigators have doggedly pursued a president who was suspended from duty for trying to impose martial law.
The impeached president said he will comply with questioning to ""prevent unsavoury bloodshed.""

Mystery balls on Sydney beaches found to contain toxic material,Authorities closed nine beaches on 14 January after the marble-sized balls washed up.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpql7wdz5vyo,feeds,articles,['Kelly Ng'],2025-01-21 06:52:33.378000+00:00,Sydney: Mystery balls on beaches filled with toxic material,"The mysterious balls thatforced the closure of several beachesin Sydney last week were found to contain saturated fatty acids, E. coli and faecal bacteria, authorities say.
Sydney's Northern Beaches council said it has sent the debris to the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) for further analysis.
Nine beaches, including popular spots Manly and Dee Why, were closed on 14 January after the marble-sized balls started washing up.
It came months after thousands of black blobs started appearing on the city's coasts in October, prompting authorities to close some of its most famous beaches for several days and order a massive clean-up.
The latest batch of balls was cleaned up from harbour beaches this week, the Northern Beaches council said in its statement on Tuesday.
It urged anyone who spotted the balls not to handle them and to contact authorities.
Besides the acids and bacteria, the balls also contained volcanic rock pumice.
Northern Beaches mayor Sue Heins said she hopes the EPA analysis will ""identify the source so that they can stop this from happening at other beaches"".
""We are continuing to conduct regular inspections of our beaches and encourage the community to report any sightings,"" she said.
Thefirst batch of debris in Octoberwere at first mistakenly called ""tar balls"" but were later found to contain everything from cooking oil and soap scum molecules, to blood pressure medication, pesticides, hair, methamphetamine and veterinary drugs.
Scientists said they resembled fat, oil and grease blobs - often called ""fatbergs"" - which are commonly formed in sewage systems.
But Sydney Water has reported that its water treatment plants are operating normally and that there were no known issues with waste systems in the city.
The country's federal police says it will increase efforts to deal with surging anti-Jewish crimes.

Mozambique opposition leader open to serving in rival's government,Venâncio Mondlane tells the BBC the conditions under which he is prepared to join the government. ,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70kzkyg0ggo,feeds,articles,['Ian Wafula'],2025-01-21 00:39:01.089000+00:00,Mozambique's Venâncio Mondlane open to serving in Daniel Chapo's government,"Mozambique's main opposition leader Venâncio Mondlane has told the BBC he is prepared to serve in the government if President Daniel Chapo meets his demands to end the political crisis that has hit the country following disputed elections.
Chapo said he had set up a team that was ""considering"" whether his rival should be invited to join a new ""inclusive"" government.
The two men outlined their positions in separate interviews with the BBC, giving the impression that they were open to rapprochement after the deaths of about 300 people in post-election unrest.
Mondlane rejected his defeat in October's election, saying the result was rigged - something that Chapo denied.
Mozambique's highest court declared Chapo the winner with 65% of the vote to Mondlane's 24%.
Chapo was the candidate of the ruling Frelimo party, as his predecessor, Filipe Nyusi, had to step down after serving two terms in office.
Chapo was officially sworn in as president on 15 January, about a week after Mondlane held his own inauguration to declare himself the ""people's president"".
Mondlane told the BBC that Chapo was ""forced"" on the nation, and was the ""president of the defence force"".
Mondlane said that he had, nevertheless, decided to suspend protests for the first 100 days of his rival's term on condition he did the following:
Mondlane said that if Chapo agreed to this, he would ""open a window"" for negotiations or else he would call on his supporters to renew protests.
Asked whether he was prepared to work in Chapo's government, Mondlane replied: ""Yes, if he has a genuine interest to work with me. He's got a chance to invite me to the table of dialogue.""
In his interview with the BBC, Chapo said he wanted to ""govern in an inclusive way"", and to introduce reforms to address concerns about the electoral law, human rights and freedom of expression.
He said talks were currently taking place with opposition parties represented in the new parliament, and they would later be widened to include ""all segments of society"".
Chapo added that he wanted to form a government that was ""open to all Mozambicans"", but he wanted to stress that ""the profile of the people is very important"".
Asked whether he believed Mondlane qualified to serve in government, Chapo replied: ""It will depend... because there is a team that is right now considering that, on the profile of the people, their competencies, their meritocracy, the patriotism - all these pre-requisites that I'm alluding to.
""If the team reaches the conclusion that these people have the right profile, they will be part of the government. Those who do not have that profile will not take part.""
Aged 47, Chapo was chosen by Frelimo, which has been in power since independence 49 years ago, as its candidate to rally young voters affected by high unemployment, and fed up with the party's decades-long rule.
He told the BBC that he wanted both local and foreign investment to increase in Mozambique in order to make the economy ""more dynamic"".
This would help create jobs for young people so that they could ""build their homes, establish their families and stabilize their lives"".
Mondlane, 50, was seen to have considerable support among young people after he rallied them during the election campaign with the slogan ""Save Mozambique - this country is ours"".
He contested the poll as an independent after breaking away from the main opposition Renamo party.
A small party that backed his candidacy won a few parliamentary seats in the election.

Inside Iceland's futuristic farm growing algae for food,Next to a geothermal plant in Iceland a start-up is growing microalgae for food. ,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjry6dv4yo,feeds,articles,['Adrienne Murray'],2025-01-21 00:00:04.073000+00:00,Inside Iceland's futuristic farm growing algae for food,"In the shadow of Iceland’s largest geothermal power station, a large warehouse houses a hi-tech indoor farm of sorts that’s like nothing I’ve ever seen.
Under a strange pink-purple glow, illuminated panels buzz and cylindrical columns of water bubble away as a futuristic crop of microalgae grows.
It's here that Iceland's Vaxa Technologies has developed a system that harnesses energy and other resources from the nearby power plant to cultivate these tiny aquatic organisms.
“It's a new way of thinking about food production,” says general manager Kristinn Haflidason as he gives me a tour of the space-age facility.
For much of our history, humans have consumed seaweed, also known as macroalgae.
But its tiny relative, microalgae has been a less common food source, although it was eaten for centuries in ancient Central America and Africa.
Now scientists and entrepreneurs are increasingly exploring its potential as a nutrition-rich, sustainable food.
About 35 minutes from the capital Reykjavik, the Vaxa site produces the microalgae Nannochloropsis, both as food for people, and for feed in fish and shrimp farming.
It also grows a type of bacteria called Arthospira, also known as blue-green algae, as it shares similar properties with microalgae.
When dried out it is known as spirulina and is used as a dietary supplement, a food ingredient, and as a bright-blue food colouring.
These tiny organisms photosynthesise, capturing energy from light to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.
“The algae is eating CO2, or turning the CO2 into biomass,” explains Mr Haflidason. “It's carbon negative.”
Vaxa's plant has a unique situation.
It's the only place where algae cultivation is integrated with a geothermal power station, which supplies clean electricity, delivers cold water for cultivation, hot water for heating, and even pipes across its CO2 emissions.
“You end up with a slightly negative carbon footprint,” says Asger Munch Smidt-Jensen, a food technology consultant at Danish Technology Institute (DTI), who co-authored a study assessing the environmental impact of Vaxa’s spirulina production.
“We also found a relatively low footprint, both in terms of land and water use.”
Round-the-clock renewable energy, plus a stream of CO2, and nutrients with a low carbon footprint, are needed to ensure the setup is climate-friendly, and he thinks that isn’t easily replicated.
“There is a huge input of energy to run these photo-bioreactors, and you have to artificially simulate the sun, so you need a high energy light source,” he explains.
""My main takeaway is that we should utilise these areas [like Iceland] where we have low impact energy sources to make energy intensive products,” adds Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen.
Back at the algae plant, I climb onto an elevated platform, where I’m surrounded by noisy modular units called photo-bioreactors, where thousands upon thousands of tiny red and blue LED lights fuel the microalgae’s growth, in place of sunlight.
They’re also supplied water and nutrients.
“More than 90% of the photosynthesis happens within very specific wavelengths of red and blue light,” explains Mr Haflidason. “We are only giving them the light that they use.”
All the conditions are tightly controlled and optimised by machine learning, he adds.
About 7% of the crop is harvested daily and rapidly replenished by new growth.
Vaxa’s facility can produce up to 150 metric tonnes of algae annually and it plans to expand.
As the crops are rich in protein, carbohydrates, omega-3s, fatty-acids, and vitamin B12, Mr Haflidason believes growing microalgae this way could help tackle global food insecurity.
Many other companies are betting on the potential of microalgae - it's estimated the market will be worth $25.4bn (£20.5bn) by 2033.
Danish start-up Algiecel has been trialling portable shipping container-sized modules that house photo-bioreactors, and which could link up to carbon-emitting industries to capture their CO2, while simultaneously producing food and feed.
Crops are also being used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, biofuel and a replacement for plastic.
Perhaps also microalgae could be produced in space.
In a project funded by the European Space Agency, the Danish Technological Institution plans to test if a microalgae can begrown on the International Space Station.
Despite all the investment, there’s some way to go before microalgae becomes an everyday part of our diet.
It still needs a lot of development, according to Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen.
He points out that the texture lacks firmness. Meanwhile the taste can be ""fishy"" if the algae is a saltwater variety.
“But there are ways of overcoming this,” he adds.
There’s also the societal question.
“Are people ready for it? How do we make it so that everyone wants to eat this?""
Malene Lihme Olsen, a food scientist at Copenhagen University who researches micro algae, says its nutritional value needs more research.
""Green microalgae [chlorella] have a very robust cell wall, so it can be difficult for us to digest and get all the nutrients,” she says.
For now she says microalgae is better added to other “carrier products” like pasta or bread to help with taste, texture and appearance.
However, Ms Olsen believes microalgae are a promising future food.
“If you compare one hectare of soy in Brazil, and imagine we had one hectare of algae field, you could produce 15 times more protein a year [from the algae].”
Back at the plant I'm looking at an unappetising green sludge. It's the harvested microalgae with the water squeezed out, ready for further processing.
Mr Haflidason offers me a taste and, after initial reluctance, I try some and find its flavour neutral with a texture like tofu.
“We are absolutely not proposing that anyone should eat green sludge,” jokes Mr Haflidason.
Instead the processed algae is an ingredient for everyday foods, and in Reykjavik one bakery makes bread with Spirulina and a gym puts it in smoothies.
“We’re not going to change what you eat. We're just going to change the nutritional value of the foods that you eat,” he says.

Best of 'frenemies': Trump's relationship with Europe this time may be very different,"Weak, distracted and unprepared? How prepared France, Germany and the rest of the continent really are for his return to power",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93ll927v18o,feeds,articles,['Katya Adler'],2025-01-21 00:01:34.921000+00:00,Where Trump's 'frenemy' relationship with Europe goes from here,"""It's insane! We're heading for a general election. The country feels broken. Our economy is stagnant... But most German news outlets just seem obsessed with Trump, Trump, Trump!""
Iris Mühler, a teacher in engineering in north-east Germany is one of a number of voters I've been talking to ahead of February snap elections. She isn't alone in her perception.
Despite facing a whole raft of its own domestic difficulties - not least in leading EU countries, Germany and France - Europe has been very Trump-focused since he won the US presidential election in November.
The continent had a bumpy ride last time he was in the White House. Many fear Trump 2.0 could be a lot worse. And Europe's traditional powers are already struggling with their own problems.
France and Germany aremired in political and economic woes, the EU as a whole lags behind China and the US in terms of competitiveness, while in the UK, public services are in a woeful state.
So: is the continent prepared for Donald Trump or has it been caught napping at the wheel (again)?
When it comes to trade and defence, Trump acts more like a transactional businessman than a US statesman who prizes transatlantic alliances dating back to World War Two.
""He simply doesn't believe in win-win partnerships,"" the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel told me. She experienced Trump last time he was in office and concluded he views the world through the prism of winners and losers.
He's convinced that Europe has taken advantage of the US for years and that's got to stop.
Leaders in Europe havewatched open-mouthedthese last weeks since Trump won the US presidential election, for the second time. He's chosen to publicly lambast allies in Europe and Canada, rather than focus his ire on those he recognises as a strategic threat, like China.
Trump dangles thepossibility of abandoning Nato- the transatlantic military alliance that Europe has relied on for its security for decades. He has said he'd ""encourage"" Russia to do ""whatever the hell they want"" with European allies if they ""don't pay"" their way more and boost their defence spending.
When it comes to trade, Trump is clearly as livid with the EU now as he was during his first term in office. The bloc sells far more to the United States than it imports from the US. In January 2022, the trade surplus was €15.4 billion (£13 billion).
Donald Trump's answer? He says he'll imposeblanket tariffs on all foreign importsof 10-20%, with even higher tariffs on certain goods like cars.
That's a disaster scenario for Germany, which relies on exports and the automobile industry in particular. Its economy is already spluttering - last year it shrunk by 0.2%.
As the biggest economy in the eurozone, financial difficulties in Germany risk affecting the currency as a whole.
Merkel has said that when he was president last time, Trump appeared to have it in for Germany.
Ian Bond, the deputy director for the Centre for European Reform, believes the country will remain ""top of Trump's (European) hit list.""
""What he said in the past is things like, he doesn't want to see any Mercedes-Benz on the streets of New York. Now, this is kind of nuts, because, actually, most of the Mercedes-Benz that you see on the streets of New York are made in Alabama, where Mercedes has a big plant.
""He has often been more hostile to Germany than any other country in Europe. It might be slightly easier for Germany with a new and more conservative government (after the upcoming general election), but I wouldn't be holding my breath.""
The UK hopes to avoid Trump tariffsas it doesn't have such a trade imbalance with the US, but it may well get lashed by tail winds if it comes to an EU-US trade war.
Trump's bullish style can come as no surprise to allies after his first term in the White House. The real conundrum for Europe now is his unpredictability: How much is bluster and intimidation and how much is a promise of action?
Ian Lesser, vice president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States think tank, believes Trump's tariff threats are real and that Europe is far from ready.
""They're not prepared, no one really is. This very different approach to global trade upsets many cornerstones of the international economy, which has evolved over decades.""
The European Commission claims to be ready for any number of moves by Trump when he returns to the White House. It is a huge trade power on the world stage. But Mr Lesser says the biggest impact on Europe could come if Trump launches anaggressive trade war against China. That could result in supply chain disruptions for Europe and Beijing dumping even more cheap products on European markets, to the detriment of local businesses.
""For Europe it's double exposure: exposure to what America might do and then what China will do in response.""
What complicates things further is that trade and defence aren't separate issues for Trump and his administration. He recently refused to rule out economic and/or military action against EU and Nato member Denmark if it didn't hand over the autonomous territory Greenland to the US.
And Trump's incoming vice president appeared, this autumn, to make US defence of Europe conditional on EU regulatory bodies stepping away from the social platform X.
JD Vance warned the US could pull its support for Nato if the EU continued alongstanding investigation into X, which is owned by Trump's Golden Boy, Elon Musk.
Recently, Mr Musk also displayed a keenness for taking sides in European politics. He launched repeated online attacks against centre-left European leaders Sir Keir Starmer in the UK and outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Musk posted on X that the extreme anti-migration AfD party was Germany's only hope.
This shocked many in Europe but pollsters suggest Mr Musk's controversial posts have little actual influence on European public opinion.
Trump and Mr Musk are widely distrusted in Europe, as clearly illustrated in a new poll commissioned by the European Council of Foreign Relations, entitled The EU and global public opinion after the US elections.
In the end, different European leaders have different approaches to ""Taming the Trump,"" as insiders describe attempts. Some flatter his not-exactly-tiny ego.
French President Emmanuel Macron is the expert here. He was one of thefirst world leaders to congratulate Trumpon social media after his re-election in November and he swiftly invited him to attend the glittering and dignitary-resplendent re-opening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.
When he was first in the White House, President Macron wowed Trump as guest of honour at the annual display of pomp and military might of Bastille Day in Paris.
The UK, meanwhile, knows Trump has a soft spot for Scotland, where his mother comes from, and for the British Royal Family. He visibly relishedattending a state banquetwith the now-late Queen Elizabeth II in 2019. He heaped praise on Prince William after sitting down with him this autumn.
Others in Europe favour flashing the cash.
European Central Bank (ECB) chief, Christine Lagarde, has advised Europe's leaders to adopt a ""cheque-book strategy"" and negotiate with Trump rather than retaliate against his proposed tariffs.
Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, speaks of buying more (expensive) US liquified natural gas (LNG) as part of Europe's effort to diversify its energy supplies. It has been weaning itself off a reliance on cheap Russian gas since the Kremlin launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Sources in the Commission also speak of possibly buying more US agricultural products and weapons.
Macron, meanwhile, has long advocated what he calls ""strategic autonomy"" - essentially Europe learning to be more self-sufficient, in order to survive.
""Europe... can die and that depends entirely on our choices,"" he said this spring.
Covid showed Europe how dependent it was on Chinese imports, like medicines. Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine exposed Europe'sover-reliance on Russian energy.
Macron is now sounding the alarm about the US: ""The United States of America has two priorities. The USA first, and that is legitimate, and the China issue, second. And the European issue is not a geopolitical priority for the coming years and decades.""
Trump's return to the White House is making European leaders think about continental weaknesses.
When it comes to defence, Trump's insistence that Europe spend more is generally accepted (though how much more is a hot topic of debate). But where Trump talks in terms of increasing GDP spending, Europeans are discussing how to spend their defence budgets more wisely and in a more joined-up way to boost continental safety.
Emmanuel Macron wants an EU-wide industrial defence policy. He says the war in Ukraine illustrated that ""our fragmentation is a weakness... We have sometimes discovered ourselves, as Europeans, that our guns were not of the same calibre, that our missiles did not match.""
Europe frets that Trump will not want to continuebeing the main sponsor of military aid to Ukraineas was the case under the Biden administration.
Next month, EU leaders have invited the UK - one of Europe's two big military powers - to an informal summit to discuss working together better on security and defence.
The EU's defence chief and former Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, believes European unity of purpose is needed. ""We need to act in a united way. Then, we are strong. Then, we are also serious on the world stage.""
There are analysts who say Europe is in a far weaker, more fractured state to deal with Trump 2.0 than it was in 2016 when he was first elected. I'd say the answer to that is yes. But also no.
Yes - as discussed, economic growth is sluggish and politics are volatile.
Populist nationalist eurosceptic parties are gaining strength in many European countries. Some, like Germany's AfD, are soft on Moscow - while others like Italian PM Giorgia Meloni may be tempted to prioritise transatlantic ties with Trump rather than European unity.
But beware of looking back at Europe when Trump was first elected president through rose-tinted spectacles.
Financially, northern Europe was definitely doing better than it is now, but, in terms of unity, the continent was deeply divided on the back of the migrant crisis in 2015. Populist eurosceptic parties were also on the rise then and, following the Brexit vote in June 2016, there were widespread predictions the EU would soon lose other member countries and fall apart altogether.
Fast forward to 2025 and the EU has weathered Brexit, the Covid pandemic, the migration crisis and Trump's first term in office - and countries very much pulled together afterRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
It was more of a stumbling, rather than sailing through these successive crises, but the EU is still standing and the wounds of Brexit, for example, have healed with time.
Post-Brexit UK is seen by the EU as a close ally that shares the same values in a world threatened by an ambitious China, an expansionist Russia and an unpredictable, bullish incoming US president.
Nato, meanwhile, though worried about Trump's commitment to the alliance, has been boosted militarily and geostrategically by Sweden and Russian neighbour Finland becoming members following the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Maybe, just maybe, Trump will see fewer differences that frustrate and antagonise him about Europe this time round.
It's a Europe that recognises the need to spend more on defence, as he demands; that is far warier of China, as he expects, and that is more right-leaning in its politics, as he prefers.
Is it a Europe whose leaders also stand up to Trump, despite threats and bluster, if they feel he crosses a line - be it over human rights, free speech or dallying with dictators?
The next chapter in relations between transatlantic frenemies waits to be written.
